AB  - Climate change, driven by increases in human-produced greenhouse gases and particles (collectively referred to as GHGs), is the most serious environmental issue facing society. The need to reduce GHGs has become urgent as heat waves, heavy rain events, and other impacts of climate change have become more frequent and severe. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, more than 136 countries, accounting for about 80% of total global GHG emissions, have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. A growing number of cities, regional governments, and industries have also made pledges to reduce emissions. Providing decision makers with useful, accurate, and trusted GHG emissions information is a crucial part of this effort. This report examines existing and emerging approaches used to generate and evaluate GHG emissions information at global to local scales. The report develops a framework for evaluating GHG emissions information to support and guide policy makers about its use in decision making. The framework identifies six criteria or pillars that can be used to evaluate and improve GHG emissions information: usability and timeliness, information transparency, evaluation and validation, completeness, inclusivity, and communication. The report recommends creating a coordinated repository or clearinghouse to operationalize the six pillars, for example, by providing timely, transparent, traceable information; standardized data formats; and governance mechanisms that are coordinated, trusted, and inclusive of the global community. © National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In this chapter, we explore some of the technologies and other means by which humans observe and monitor a variety of ocean characteristics and processes and how they relate to human health and well-being. Specifically, we discuss observing and monitoring: (a) the physical environment, (b) the growing problem of plastic waste in the ocean, (c) marine biodiversity, (d) marine fisheries, (e) harmful algal blooms, (f) naturally occurring infectious microbes, and (g) monitoring of marine mammals as indicators of ocean environmental effects on humans. We conclude with a discussion about how data from a broad range of ocean, coastal, community, and health surveillance efforts might be integrated into a comprehensive coastal human health observing system in the not-so-distant future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The role of phytoplankton as ocean primary producers and their influence on global biogeochemical cycles makes them arguably the most important living organisms in the sea. Like plants on land, phytoplankton exhibit seasonal cycles that are controlled by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Nearshore coastal waters often contain the highest levels of phytoplankton biomass. Yet, owing to difficulties in sampling this dynamic region, less is known about the seasonality of phytoplankton in the nearshore (e.g., surf zone) compared to offshore coastal, shelf and open ocean waters. Here, we analyse an annual dataset of chlorophyll-a concentration—a proxy of phytoplankton biomass—and sea surface temperature (SST) collected by a surfer at Bovisand Beach in Plymouth, UK on a near weekly basis between September 2017 and September 2018. By comparing this dataset with a complementary in-situ dataset collected 7 km offshore from the coastline (11 km from Bovisand Beach) at Station L4 of the Western Channel Observatory, and guided by satellite observations of light availability, we investigated differences in phytoplankton seasonal cycles between nearshore and offshore coastal waters. Whereas similarities in phytoplankton biomass were observed in autumn, winter and spring, we observed significant differences between sites during the summer months of July and August. Offshore (Station L4) chlorophyll-a concentrations dropped dramatically, whereas chlorophyll-a concentrations in the nearshore (Bovsiand Beach) remained high. We found chlorophyll-a in the nearshore to be significantly positively correlated with SST and PAR over the seasonal cycle, but no significant correlations were observed at the offshore location. However, offshore correlation coefficients were found to be more consistent with those observed in the nearshore when summer data (June–August 2018) were removed. Analysis of physical (temperature and density) and chemical variables (nutrients) suggest that the offshore site (Station L4) becomes stratified and nutrient limited at the surface during the summer, in contrast to the nearshore. However, we acknowledge that additional experiments are needed to verify this hypothesis. Considering predicted changes in ocean stratification, our findings may help understand how the spatial distribution of phytoplankton phenology within temperate coastal seas could be impacted by climate change. Additionally, this study emphasises the potential for using marine citizen science as a platform for acquiring environmental data in otherwise challenging regions of the ocean, for understanding ecological indicators such as phytoplankton abundance and phenology. We discuss the limitations of our study and future work needed to explore nearshore phytoplankton dynamics. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Analyses of climate change based on point observations indicate an extension of the plant growing season, which may have an impact on plant production and functioning of natural ecosystems. Analyses involving remote sensing methods, which have added more detail to results obtained in the traditional way, have been carried out only since the 1980s. The paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis of papers related to the growing season published from 2000–2021 included in the Web of Science database. Through filtering, 285 publications were selected and subjected to statistical processing and analysis of their content. This resulted in the identification of author teams that mostly focused their research on vegetation growth and in the selection of the most common keywords describing the beginning, end, and duration of the growing season. It was found that most studies on the growing season were reported from Asia, Europe, and North America (i.e., 32%, 28%, and 28%, respectively). The analyzed articles show the advantage of satellite data over low-altitude and ground-based data in providing information on plant vegetation. Over three quarters of the analyzed publications focused on natural plant communities. In the case of crops, wheat and rice were the most frequently studied plants (i.e., they were analyzed in over 30% and over 20% of publications, respectively). © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Location-based games (LBGs) are based on digital representations of our surroundings and the spaces we inhabit. These digital twins of the real world, real world metaverses, are subsequently augmented by imaginary game content. However, the virtual reconstruction of the world inevitably emphasises some aspects of reality and disregards others. In this work we explore and discuss the elements of reality that are included, and omitted, in popular commercial LBGs. We focus on eight popular contemporary LBGs from five different developers and investigate their connections to the real world. Subsequently, we compare the identified real world features of the LBGs to the landscape dimensions of the widely adopted Landscape Character Assessment framework. The findings show that settlement, hydrology, climate and land cover are the most commonly incorporated landscape dimensions, albeit in low fidelity. By contrast, dimensions, such as geology, soils and enclosure were not represented in the observed LBGs. In addition, we discovered several anthropogenic and cultural aspects, such as land ownership and time depth that are implicitly included in some commercial LBGs, notably in the Niantic Wayfarer system providing unique high-fidelity data of cultural and historical locations. Overall, we find only little variance within landscape dimensions between the observed commercial LBGs. Our findings open discussions on choices regarding the virtual representation of the real world in systems, such as LBGs, navigational software and a reality-based metaverse. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Many stakeholders, from governments to civil society to businesses, lack the data they need to make informed decisions on biodiversity, jeopardising efforts to conserve, restore and sustainably manage nature. Here we review the importance of enhancing biodiversity monitoring, assess the challenges involved and identify potential solutions. Capacity for biodiversity monitoring needs to be enhanced urgently, especially in poorer, high-biodiversity countries where data gaps are disproportionately high. Modern tools and technologies, including remote sensing, bioacoustics and environmental DNA, should be used at larger scales to fill taxonomic and geographic data gaps, especially in the tropics, in marine and freshwater biomes, and for plants, fungi and invertebrates. Stakeholders need to follow best monitoring practices, adopting appropriate indicators and using counterfactual approaches to measure and attribute outcomes and impacts. Data should be made openly and freely available. Companies need to invest in collecting the data required to enhance sustainability in their operations and supply chains. With governments soon to commit to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the time is right to make a concerted push on monitoring. However, action at scale is needed now if we are to enhance results-based management adequately to conserve the biodiversity and ecosystem services we all depend on. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A major challenge in characterizing plankton communities is the collection, identification and quantification of samples in a time-efficient way. The classical manual microscopy counts are gradually being replaced by high throughput imaging and nucleic acid sequencing. DNA sequencing allows deep taxonomic resolution (including cryptic species) as well as high detection power (detecting rare species), while RNA provides insights on function and potential activity. However, these methods are affected by database limitations, PCR bias, and copy number variability across taxa. Recent developments in high-throughput imaging applied in situ or on collected samples (high-throughput microscopy, Underwater Vision Profiler, FlowCam, ZooScan, etc) has enabled a rapid enumeration of morphologically-distinguished plankton populations, estimates of biovolume/biomass, and provides additional valuable phenotypic information. Although machine learning classifiers generate encouraging results to classify marine plankton images in a time efficient way, there is still a need for large training datasets of manually annotated images. Here we provide workflow examples that couple nucleic acid sequencing with high-throughput imaging for a more complete and robust analysis of microbial communities. We also describe the publicly available and collaborative web application EcoTaxa, which offers tools for the rapid validation of plankton by specialists with the help of automatic recognition algorithms. Finally, we describe how the field is moving with citizen science programs, unmanned autonomous platforms with in situ sensors, and sequencing and digitalization of historical plankton samples.

AB  - Systematic long-Term studies on ecosystem dynamics are largely lacking from the East Antarctic Southern Ocean, although it is well recognized that they are indispensable to identify the ecological impacts and risks of environmental change. Here, we present a framework for establishing a long-Term cross-disciplinary study on decadal timescales. We argue that the eastern Weddell Sea and the adjacent sea to the east, off Dronning Maud Land, is a particularly well suited area for such a study, since it is based on findings from previous expeditions to this region. Moreover, since climate and environmental change have so far been comparatively muted in this area, as in the eastern Antarctic in general, a systematic long-Term study of its environmental and ecological state can provide a baseline of the current situation, which will be important for an assessment of future changes from their very onset, with consistent and comparable time series data underpinning and testing models and their projections. By establishing an Integrated East Antarctic Marine Research (IEAMaR) observatory, long-Term changes in ocean dynamics, geochemistry, biodiversity, and ecosystem functions and services will be systematically explored and mapped through regular autonomous and ship-based synoptic surveys. An associated long-Term ecological research (LTER) programme, including experimental and modelling work, will allow for studying climate-driven ecosystem changes and interactions with impacts arising from other anthropogenic activities. This integrative approach will provide a level of long-Term data availability and ecosystem understanding that are imperative to determine, understand, and project the consequences of climate change and support a sound science-informed management of future conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean.  © Copyright:

AB  - Monitoring the status of species is crucial for biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource management in tropical forests, but conventional in situ monitoring methods are impractical over large scales. Scientists have resorted to two potentially complementary approaches: local ecological knowledge (LEK) and remote sensing. To gauge the potential of combining LEK and remote sensing for assessing species status at landscape scales, a large-scale assessment of the reliability of both measures is critical but hampered by the lack of ground-level data. We conducted a landscape-scale assessment of LEK and remote sensing, using a survey of over 900 communities (a near census in our study area) and nearly 4,000 households in 235 randomly selected communities in the Peruvian Amazon—the largest LEK survey as yet undertaken in tropical forests. The survey collected LEK data on the presence of 20 indicator species from both community leaders/elders and randomly sampled households. We assessed LEK and remotely sensed land cover—forest cover and nonmain channel open water—as proxies for species habitat, across species (game, fish, and timber), over time (current and historical), and by indigeneity (Indigenous peoples and mestizos). Overall, LEK and remotely sensed land cover corroborate each other well. Concordance is highest for the current status of game species reported by sampled households, as is the concordance of historical LEK from Indigenous community leaders/elders. The results point to the promise of combining LEK and remote sensing in monitoring the status of species in data-poor tropical forests. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

AB  - Marine and freshwater biodiversity is under threat from both natural and manmade causes. Biological monitoring is currently a top priority for biodiversity protection. Given present limitations, traditional biological monitoring methods may not achieve the proposed monitoring aims. Environmental DNA metabarcoding technology reflects species information by capturing and extracting DNA from environmental samples, using molecular biology techniques to sequence and analyze the DNA, and comparing the obtained information with existing reference libraries to obtain species identification. However, its practical application has highlighted several limitations. This paper summarizes the main steps in the environmental application of eDNA metabarcoding technology in aquatic ecosystems, including the discovery of unknown species, the detection of invasive species, and evaluations of biodiversity. At present, with the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence, certain advanced technologies and devices can be combined with environmental DNA metabarcoding technology to promote further development of aquatic species monitoring and management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biosensor technology represents a novel tool with several areas of application, such as biomedical and physicochemical ones. In this review, we considered this technology's application to physiological analyses in the area of biological response to climate change and environmental monitoring, with particular attention to the coral reefs. For their peculiar biology and sensitivity, coral reefs are considered nowadays as one of the most endangered marine ecosystems. Because of their natural and economical importance, analytical methods for evaluating the reef's health status are highly required to improve their protection. Several techniques based on different approaches are applied to coral reef research, mostly represented by remote surveys, in situ morphological observations, and laboratory-bound approaches. Only lately, some physiological in situ techniques have been proposed. The development of de-centralized biosensors could represent a terrific enhancement towards a real-time comprehension of coral reef health, especially in those areas that are scarcely accessible and/or with a low amount of sample to test. Here we provide a detailed discussion about morphological and physiological aspects of the coral reef in situ analyses, providing the readers a critical overview of the advantages and limitations of current methodologies for coral reef monitoring. The desirable role of biosensors along the critical field of coral reefs’ assessment is highlighted and analyzed as a potential scenario for overcoming current limitations in climate change and local anthropogenic stressors monitoring. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Global change is causing ecosystems to change at unprecedented rates and the urgency to quantify ecological change is high. We therefore need all possible sources of ecological data to address key knowledge gaps. Ground-based photos are a form of remote sensing and an unconventional data source with a high potential to improve our understanding of ecological change. They can provide invaluable information on ecological conditions in the past and present at relevant spatiotemporal scales that is very difficult to obtain with other approaches. Here we review the use of ground-based photos in a set of relevant ecological research topics, such as biodiversity and community ecology, phenology, global change ecology and landscape ecology. We highlight three main photo-based methods in ecological research (repeat photography, time-lapse photography and public archives), alongside which we discuss three case studies to demonstrate novel applications of these methods, to answer fundamental ecological questions. Synthesis. Photos can significantly support ecological research to improve our understanding of biotic responses in a rapidly changing world. Photos cover relatively large temporal and spatial scales, and can provide large amounts of information with limited time investment. To exploit their full potential, we need to invest not only in technological advances to compile, process and analyse images but also in proper data management. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The proliferation of Citizen Science initiatives has increased the expectations of practitioners who need data for design, analysis, management and research in environmental applications. Many Citizen Science experiences have reported tangible societal benefits related to improved governance of natural resources due to the involvement of citizens and communities. However, from the perspective of data generation, most of the literature on Citizen Science tends to regard it as a potentially cost-effective source of data, with major concerns about the quality of data. The Ground Truth 2.0 project brought the opportunity to examine the scope of this potential by analysing the value of citizen-generated data. We propose a methodology to account for the value of citizen observations as a function of their complementarity to existing environmental observations and the evolution of their costs in time. The application of the proposed methodology in the chosen case studies that were all established using a co-design approach shows that the cost of obtaining Citizen Science data is not as low as frequently stated in literature. This is because the costs associated with co-design events for creating a Citizen Science community, as well as the functional and technical design of the tools, are much higher than the costs of rolling out the actual observation campaigns. In none of the considered cases did an increment in the number of preparatory events translate into an immediate increase in the collected observations. Nevertheless, Citizen Science appears to have the greatest value in places where in-situ environmental monitoring is not implemented. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - We review the current knowledge of the biodiversity of the ocean as well as the levels of decline and threat for species and habitats. The lack of understanding of the distribution of life in the ocean is identified as a significant barrier to restoring its biodiversity and health. We explore why the science of taxonomy has failed to deliver knowledge of what species are present in the ocean, how they are distributed and how they are responding to global and regional to local anthropogenic pressures. This failure prevents nations from meeting their international commitments to conserve marine biodiversity with the results that investment in taxonomy has declined in many countries. We explore a range of new technologies and approaches for discovery of marine species and their detection and monitoring. These include: imaging methods, molecular approaches, active and passive acoustics, the use of interconnected databases and citizen science. Whilst no one method is suitable for discovering or detecting all groups of organisms many are complementary and have been combined to give a more complete picture of biodiversity in marine ecosystems. We conclude that integrated approaches represent the best way forwards for accelerating species discovery, description and biodiversity assessment. Examples of integrated taxonomic approaches are identified from terrestrial ecosystems. Such integrated taxonomic approaches require the adoption of cybertaxonomy approaches and will be boosted by new autonomous sampling platforms and development of machine-speed exchange of digital information between databases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This book focuses, in seven chapters, on the perspectives and solutions that different research groups offer to try to address problems related to SDG 14: Life Below Water. The different objectives developed in SDG 14 are treated independently, with an attempt to give a global vision of the issues. The mechanism used to select the book's content was through an Artificial Intelligence program, choosing articles related to the topics by means of keywords. The program selected those articles, and those that were not related to the topic or did not focus on SDG 14 were discarded by a subject matter expert. Obviously, the selection was partial and the entire subject is not covered, but the final product gives a very solid idea of ??how to orient ourselves to delve deeper into the topic of SDG 14 using published chapters and articles. The AI program itself selected the text of these contributions to show the progress in different topics related to SDG 14. This mode of operation will allow specialists (and non-specialists) to collect useful information for their specific research purposes in a short period of time. At a time when information is essential in order to move quickly by providing concrete answers to complex problems, this type of approach will become essential for researchers, especially for a subject as vast as SDG 14. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - For nearly three decades, satellite nadir altimeters have provided essential information to understand primarily ocean but also inland water dynamics. A variety of parameters can be inferred via altimeter measurements, including sea surface height, sea surface wind speeds, significant wave heights, and topography of land, sea ice, and ice sheets. Taking advantage of these parameters with the long record of altimeter data spanning multiple decades has allowed a diverse range of societal applications. As the constellation of altimeter satellites grows, the proven value of the missions to a diverse user community can now be demonstrated by highlighting a selection of verifiable success stories. In this paper, we review selected altimeter success stories that incorporate altimetry data, alone or in conjunction with numerical models or other Earth observations, to solve a key societal problem. First, we define the problem or the key challenge of each use case, and then we articulate the uptake of the successful altimeter-based solution. Our review revealed steady progress by scientific and stakeholder communities in bridging the gap between data availability and their actual uptake to address a variety of applications. Highlighting these altimeter-based success stories can serve to further promote the widespread adoption of future satellite missions such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission scheduled for launch in 2022. Knowledge of the breadth of current utility of altimeter observations can help the scientific community to demonstrate the value in continuing radar altimeter and similar missions, particularly those with expanded capabilities, such as SWOT. © 2022 American Meteorological Society For information regarding reuse of this content and general copyright information, consult the AMS Copyright Policy.

AB  - Farmers face a number of difficulties on a daily basis, including the inability to document farm input costs, farm chemical expenditures, and statistics on farm output, as well as obtain information from other stakeholders (such as agriculture advisers). Farmers’ findings are gathered via a crowdsourcing strategy; the project is run through a smartphone application called ClimMob, which combines and analyzes decentralized field data from multiple growers. As more non-governmental groups and national agricultural research organizations use the online platform for their own initiatives, ClimMob is starting to take on a life of its own. When it comes to data accessibility, agricultural growth in remote places, and other factors, we come to the conclusion that mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) applications are highly valued in strengthening these areas. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - With the increasing threat of wildfires globally, improving the availability of accurate, spatially explicit fuel type information is critical for fire behavior predictions that can support management decisions to mitigate fire hazards. Since mapping surface fuel types using airborne or spaceborne sensors relies on ground truth data from laborious field assessments, here we propose a novel proximate sensing-based approach for classifying surface fuel types from in-forest RGB photographs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We test different configurations of deep learning models that integrate photographs of the forest stand and the forest floor as well as time series of multispectral satellite data from Sentinel-2 using long short-term memory (LSTM), and compare their performance in classifying understory and litter fuel types of Central European forests. We also investigate how ensemble approaches based on majority voting can help to improve classification results. We found that understory fuel types were classified with highest accuracy after cross-validation (0.78) using a combination of horizontal stand photos and forest floor photos. This accuracy was further improved by post-classification decision fusion of model predictions on multiple photographs of a forest stand and by considering the model's confidence in its predictions (0.85). Litter fuel type classification based on forest photographs resulted in lower overall accuracy (0.60), but using model ensemble predictions on both photographs and Sentinel-2 time series significantly improved the results (0.72). We found that the accuracy of our models was mostly limited by naturally smooth transitions between the defined fuel type classes and the co-occurrence of multiple fuel types in a photograph. This study shows that deep learning methods can provide an efficient means to assess fuel types from GNSS-located photos of forest stands as a basis for generating and validating fuel type and finally fire risk maps. The necessary data can be readily collected by forest managers or citizen scientists. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Openly shared low-cost electronic hardware applications, known as open electronics, have sparked a new open-source movement, with much untapped potential to advance scientific research. Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global "maker"community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Coral reef ecosystems are rich in biodiversity, providing a variety of services and products relevant to blue economy that include sectors such as tourism, fisheries, biotechnology/bioprospecting, and coastal protection. Almost half a billion people, 8% of the total global population, live within 100 km of a coral reef and about 100 developing countries are highly dependent on coral reefs for their livelihoods. However, the health of coral reefs is at risk. Reefs are severely affected by ocean warming and acidification as well as land-and sea-based human activities that lead to coral disease and destruction of reef habitat. This chapter addresses aspects of coral reef ecosystems that are critical for their contribution to sustainable blue economies. The chapter discusses the structure and function of coral reefs, their current distri-butions, the threats they experience and their potential impact as a blue economy resource. The chapter then discusses necessary measures to detect, monitor, and reduce the adverse impacts, as well as the available science and technologies to monitor reefs. Finally, the chapter provides information about ongoing international efforts on reef research and monitoring, and the application of state-of-the-art tools that might be of interest to countries developing blue economies. © The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM SandT Centre) 2022.

AB  - Environmental Sensor Networks comprise arrays of devices containing sensors, which are interconnected using a wireless network. These can be linked with other data sources and provide near real-time data to facilitate monitoring and understanding of the environment. When combined with decision-making systems, they can be used for disaster management. In this chapter, we discuss the evolution from logging, to sensor networks, to the environmental Internet of things (IoT). We highlight systems to investigate different geomorphological processes, then those that have already been used to investigate hazards. We then outline the challenges of software, data, and network integration. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The complex interactions from anthropogenic activities, climate change, sedimentation and the input of wastewater has significantly affected the aquatic environment and entire ecosystem. Over the years, the researchers have investigated water monitoring approaches in terms of traditional monitoring or even integrated systems to handle such an environmental assessment and predictions based on warning systems. However, research into the selection and optimization of water monitoring systems by the combination of parallel approach in terms of sampling techniques, process analysis and results is limited. The research objectives of the present study are to evaluate the existing water monitoring systems based on the latest approach and then provide insights into factors affecting sensor implementation at sampling locations. Here we summarize the advancement and trends of various water monitoring systems as well as the suitability of sensor placement in the area by reviewing more than 300 papers published between 2011 and 2022. The research highlights the urgency of an integrative approach with regard to water monitoring systems including water quality model and water quantity model. A framework is proposed to incorporate all water monitoring approaches, sampling techniques, and predictive models to provide comprehensive information about environmental assessment. It was observed that the urgency of model-based approaches as verification and fusion of data assemble has the ability to improve the performances of the systems. Furthermore, integrated systems with the inclusion of a separate modeling approach through integrated, semi-mechanistic models, data science and artificial intelligence are recommended in the future. Overall, this study provides guidelines for achieving standardized water management by implementing integrated water monitoring systems. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper reviews the current status and development of remote sensing methods for monitoring rangeland condition. Remote sensing offers ideal solutions for assessing ecological indicators in vast and remote rangeland regions, with expanding opportunities emerging through new platforms, sensors and analytical methods. We summarise indicators widely used to assess rangeland ecosystem structure, function, and composition and review remote sensing methods for measuring them. We present a framework for rating the maturity of these methods and evaluate their potential for implementation into operational monitoring programmes. There is a distinct lack of uptake of remote sensing methods beyond regional-scale satellite products, with on-ground approaches remaining dominant for many essential indicators. However, we highlight considerable recent research using rapidly developing sensor and platform technologies, such as LiDAR and UAVs, which provide unprecedented types and resolutions of data and are driving development of information extraction methods. Three-dimensional modelling using structure from motion (SfM) and LiDAR is increasingly used for measuring all aspects of ecosystem condition and may also improve assessment of ecological indicators where spectral sensing has reached its limit. We introduce a framework for assessing remote sensing capabilities and maturity, and provide an overview of development pathways, which will focus ongoing research and development. It may also stimulate uptake of well-developed remote sensing methodologies into operational monitoring programmes by land managers. The use of best-available methods will greatly assist in maintaining and improving the condition of global arid ecosystems, benefiting all stakeholders in these regions, and preserving their natural services for future generations. © 2023

AB  - Intensive agricultural landscapes pose a challenge to wildlife managers, policymakers, and landowners hoping to increase the diversity of desired wildlife species, such as grassland birds, which require urgent conservation action. In intensive agricultural landscapes, like those of the Midwestern United States, most land area is privately owned and operated and managed primarily for production. Thus, conducting ecological research in intensive agricultural landscapes requires collaborative approaches aimed at farm owners and operators. Recent advances in acoustic data collection and high-resolution habitat mapping, including low-cost acoustic recorders and satellite remote sensing, may be well positioned to address this challenge by enabling expanded assessments and monitoring of wildlife populations and habitats across regions. This study examined fine-grained habitat characteristics and their relationship with avian biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes at 44 agricultural sites across the state of Iowa. Passive acoustic monitoring and manual identification of bird species allowed for measurement of vocalizing bird richness. High-resolution mapping of noncrop vegetation provided detailed information on small noncrop vegetation habitat complexes within row-crop agriculture. Measures of image texture provided characterizations of compositional heterogeneity within noncrop vegetation. General linear Poisson modeling demonstrated robust associations between noncrop vegetation and vocalizing bird richness, yet variation in grassland bird richness was not well predicted by noncrop vegetation. Noncrop vegetation texture demonstrated potential as a predictor of vocalizing bird richness, though not better than or when combined with noncrop vegetated area, indicating it may not be an independent measure of habitat quality. Passive acoustic monitoring resulted in useful data at 44 out of 60 originally selected sites, with some lost to failed recorders and/or collaboration issues. Challenges remain in detecting habitat characteristics that promote grassland birds in row crop landscapes. Working toward probabilistic research design across privately owned working landscapes and incorporating more detailed management practice information would improve the transferability of this approach to farmland management and policy. © 2023 The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The Hindu Kush Himalayan region is a sensitive ecosystem and supports a diversity of flora and fauna. However, the young mountain system of the Himalayas is subjected to various climatic and nonclimatic disturbances that threaten the biodiversity of the region. Conservation with limited information is a challenge for all the stakeholders including the decision-makers. The unique features of the Himalayas such as uneven terrain, marginality, fragility, harsh climatic conditions and the absence of long-term scientific endeavors restrict the generation of consistent quality information. Remote sensing technology transformed land surface data collection, and the infusion of new technology with improved in situ data collection using citizen science and sensor-based monitoring has further strengthened the collection of data. The increased data availability with access to algorithms and computing powr facilitates modeling for better monitoring and understanding of future climate vulnerabilities. Moreover, the integration of bioinformatics approaches could supplement geoinformatics with unseen opportunities in research and conservation. Nonetheless, dissemination of research results through web applications is rarely implemented which confines appropriate and timely information from reaching all the stakeholders. Freely accessible cloud platforms empower researchers to conduct high computation analysis of satellite imageries and geospatial data in a user-friendly single. These platforms can deploy interactive web applications without expertise in application development, programming, or HTML. Though information systems are not the principal solution, proper utilization and research-oriented performance issue tracking could guarantee valuable assistance. Therefore, proper utilization of the evolving information systems could check soft adaptation limits from reaching hard adaptation limits and thus could aid conservation and resilience planning. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST) is a 20 year-old, data-driven marine citizen science program monitoring ∼450 sites from northern California to Utqiagvik, Alaska and west through the Aleutians. COASST collects data on beachcast birds, and marine debris. An active participant corps of 800 monthly data collectors makes the program one of the larger marine science-public partnerships in the world. The program was started to create a baseline of beach deposition against which untoward change could be measured. Critical to program success is integration of the scientific and academic communities as collaborators, grant co-principal investigators, and advisory board members. A comprehensive participant support strategy including personalized feedback, active listening for co-creation and co-production opportunities, translation of COASST science in ways that are relevant and meaningful to coastal communities, and elevation of participants as skillful knowledge holders, has allowed the program to recruit broadly and enjoy high retention rates. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The aim of this study is the design and development of a conceptual and methodological framework that can be used for monitoring the condition of urban and sub urban green infrastructure (UGI) and the associated anthropogenic or natural induced pressures and threats to UGI biodiversity. Within this framework this manuscript describes in detail the development of a digital smart toolbox, which integrates data and information from satellite imagery, in-situ sensors and a smart mobile application developed to collect scientific data from public. The platform emphasizes the public participation of the urban residents for the protection and conservation of the environment. All this multi-source data can used for the sustainable management and protection of the biodiversity of urban and sub-urban UGI through the web based digital platform. In detail the following research and development activities were implemented. Originally the potential pressures and threats for the UGI biodiversity were identified and evaluated. Robust and transferable indicators for monitoring urban biodiversity using earth observation (EO) data were also formulated and developed. Different satellite EO data processing algorithms for the monitoring of potential pressures and threats to UGI biodiversity were also explored. Mobile sensors for data acquisition through citizen science to monitor biodiversity pressures and threats in UGI were also deployed. Finally, the integrated web-based platform was developed, that can be used to integrate data and provide information to the public and the authorities.  © 2023 SPIE.

AB  - The ocean is experiencing unprecedented rapid change, and visually monitoring marine biota at the spatiotemporal scales needed for responsible stewardship is a formidable task. As baselines are sought by the research community, the volume and rate of this required data collection rapidly outpaces our abilities to process and analyze them. Recent advances in machine learning enables fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data, but have had limited success in the ocean due to lack of data standardization, insufficient formatting, and demand for large, labeled datasets. To address this need, we built FathomNet, an open-source image database that standardizes and aggregates expertly curated labeled data. FathomNet has been seeded with existing iconic and non-iconic imagery of marine animals, underwater equipment, debris, and other concepts, and allows for future contributions from distributed data sources. We demonstrate how FathomNet data can be used to train and deploy models on other institutional video to reduce annotation effort, and enable automated tracking of underwater concepts when integrated with robotic vehicles. As FathomNet continues to grow and incorporate more labeled data from the community, we can accelerate the processing of visual data to achieve a healthy and sustainable global ocean. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The growth of citizen science presents a valuable potential source of calibration and validation data for environmental remote sensing at greater spatial and temporal scales, and with greater cost efficiency than is achievable by professional in situ reference-data collection alone. However, the frequent mismatch between in situ data-quality requirements for remote-sensing-product development and current data quality assurance in citizen science presents a significant challenge if widespread use of these complementary data sources is to be achieved. To evaluate the scope of this challenge, we conducted a targeted literature review into the nature of data-quality issues faced by citizen-science projects for routine incorporation into terrestrial environmental-monitoring systems. From the literature, we identify the challenges and trade-offs to inform best-practice implementation of data quality assurance in citizen-science projects. To assist practitioners in implementing our findings, we grouped these themes by stage of citizen-science project: (1) program planning and design; (2) participant engagement; (3) data collection; and (4) data processing. As a final step, we used our findings as the basis to formulate guiding questions that can be used to inform decision making when choosing optimal data-quality-improvement and assurance strategies for use of citizen science in remote-sensing calibration and/or validation. Our aim is to enhance future development of citizen-science projects for use with remote sensing in environmental monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - High-frequency water quality measurements in streams and rivers have expanded in scope and sophistication during the last two decades. Existing technology allows in situ automated measurements of water quality constituents, including both solutes and particulates, at unprecedented frequencies from seconds to subdaily sampling intervals. This detailed chemical information can be combined with measurements of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, bringing new insights into the sources, transport pathways, and transformation processes of solutes and particulates in complex catchments and along the aquatic continuum. Here, we summarize established and emerging high-frequency water quality technologies, outline key high-frequency hydrochemical data sets, and review scientific advances in key focus areas enabled by the rapid development of high-frequency water quality measurements in streams and rivers. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges for using high-frequency water quality measurements to bridge scientific and management gaps by promoting a holistic understanding of freshwater systems and catchment status, health, and function. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Land is one of the four components of production for economic development in any country. Land administration helps the governments to eradicate poverty, protect human rights, and ensure food security. To do so, governments implement land administration systems. This chapter investigates the fitness of the recent initiative of the Government of Pakistan "reforming and modernization of the cadastre" with reference to the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management recently adopted framework for effective land administration (FELA). The results of the study indicate that the ongoing efforts of the Survey of Pakistan regarding the cadastre initiative have few alignments with FELA. Institutional arrangements are present but have a weak policy and technical support to adopt the FELA. The study also argued for the use of volunteered geographic information as a big data for supporting land administration and detailed guidelines also are shared to use the VGI for land administration in Pakistan. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - Air Pollution Calculations: Quantifying Pollutant Formation, Transport, Transformation, Fate and Risks, Second Edition enhances the systems science aspects of air pollution, including transformation reactions in soil, water, sediment and biota that contribute to air pollution. This second edition will be an update based on research and actions taken since 2019 that affect air pollution calculations, including new control technologies, emissions measurement, and air quality modeling. Recent court cases, regulatory decisions, and advances in technology are discussed and, where necessary, calculations have been revised to reflect these updates. Sections discuss pollutant characterization, pollutant transformation, and environmental partitioning. Air partitioning, physical transport of air pollutants, air pollution biogeochemistry, and thermal reactions are also thoroughly explored. The author then carefully examines air pollution risk calculations, control technologies and dispersion models. The text wraps with discussions of economics and project management, reliability and failure, and air pollution decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Macroalgal cultivation is expanding rapidly, and promises to contribute significantly towards future food and energy security, sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem services and habitat provisioning for a range of associated organisms globally. Habitat provisioning underpins biodiversity and ecosystem structure and functioning, supports many ecosystem services and has possible benefits to other marine industries, including enhancement of commercial fish stocks. In macroalgal cultivation, however, only recently has habitat provisioning started to be assessed at a local scale (within a farm's footprint) and with a range of different approaches. This review evaluates techniques used to quantify habitat provisioning in and around macroalgal cultivation sites, for species ranging from microorganisms to megafauna, and outlines recommendations to enable a more comprehensive ecological valuation of macroalgal cultivation in the future. The majority of information on biodiversity associated with macroalgal cultivation is associated with quantifying biofouling or pest organisms, rather than the contribution of colonising species to healthy ecosystem functioning. We suggest how better monitoring of macroalgal cultivation could enable an ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) in the future. To achieve this, we highlight the need for standardised and robust methods for quantifying habitat provisioning that will enable assessment and monitoring of macroalgal cultivation sites of varying scales and within different regions and environmental settings. Increased evidence for the potential habitat value of macroalgal cultivation sites will help inform and shape marine legislation, licencing and certification for macroalgal farmers and potentially reduce marine user conflicts, helping the industry to continue to grow sustainably using EAA. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Modern smartphones possess powerful digital cameras that are rivaled with semiprofessional equipment. When coupled to phone processing and communicating services it widens the range of potential uses in researches. In this paper, we review the potentialities of these cameras and apps from worldwide published experiences analysis. The ability to read and register barcodes or Quick Response codes can be used as a marking or tagging method. Different apps can perform advanced morphometric analysis from captured images, for physical measuring, pattern analysis, or automated species or individual recognition. Using relatively simple external devices the field of portable microscopy has been developed. The sensor provides 8 or 16 bits in primary color channels that made possible their use in colorimetric, photometry, and spectrometry for bio analytic applications detecting and assessing the concentration of chemical substances, monitoring air quality, water turbidity of soil color. They have been used also for ultraviolet radiation monitoring. Motion activation and a video recording made possible their use in behavioral studies. All this range of applications and potentialities can turn smartphones into an important and versatile research instrument. © 2022 Universidad de La Habana. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent advancement in data science coupled with the revolution in digital and satellite technology has improved the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the forestry and wildlife sectors. India shares 7% of global forest cover and is the 8th most biodiverse region in the world. However, rapid expansion of developmental projects, agriculture, and urban areas threaten the country’s rich biodiversity. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies like AI in Indian forests and biodiversity sectors can help in effective monitoring, management, and conservation of biodiversity and forest resources. We conducted a systematic search of literature related to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) in the forestry sector and biodiversity conservation across globe and in India (using ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar). Additionally, we also collected data on AI-based startups and non-profits in forest and wildlife sectors to understand the growth and adoption of AI technology in biodiversity conservation, forest management, and related services. Here, we first provide a global overview of AI research and application in forestry and biodiversity conservation. Next, we discuss adoption challenges of AI technologies in the Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors. Overall, we find that adoption of AI technology in Indian forestry and biodiversity sectors has been slow compared to developed, and to other developing countries. However, improving access to big data related to forest and biodiversity, cloud computing, and digital and satellite technology can help improve adoption of AI technology in India. We hope that this synthesis will motivate forest officials, scientists, and conservationists in India to explore AI technology for biodiversity conservation and forest management. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Citizen science is an increasingly acknowledged approach applied in many scientific domains, and particularly within the environmental and ecological sciences, in which non-professional participants contribute to data collection to advance scientific research. We present contributory citizen science as a valuable method to scientists and practitioners within the environmental and ecological sciences, focusing on the full life cycle of citizen science practice, from design to implementation, evaluation and data management. We highlight key issues in citizen science and how to address them, such as participant engagement and retention, data quality assurance and bias correction, as well as ethical considerations regarding data sharing. We also provide a range of examples to illustrate the diversity of applications, from biodiversity research and land cover assessment to forest health monitoring and marine pollution. The aspects of reproducibility and data sharing are considered, placing citizen science within an encompassing open science perspective. Finally, we discuss its limitations and challenges and present an outlook for the application of citizen science in multiple science domains. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Invasive alien species have been rising exponentially in the last decades impacting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The soniferous weakfish, Cynoscion regalis, is a recent invasive sciaenid species in the Iberian Peninsula and was first reported in the Tagus estuary in 2015. There is concern about its possible impacts on native species, namely the confamiliar meagre, Argyrosomus regius, as there is overlap in their feeding regime, habitat use, and breeding behaviour. Here, we characterised the sciaenid-like sounds recently recorded in the Tagus estuary and showed that they are made by weakfish as they have similar numbers of pulses and pulse periods to the sounds made by captive breeding weakfish. We further demonstrate that breeding grunts from weakfish and the native sciaenid, recorded either in captivity or Tagus estuary, differ markedly in sound duration, number of pulses and pulse period in the two species, but overlap in their spectral features. Importantly, these differences are easily detected through visual and aural inspections of the recordings, making acoustic recognition easy even for the non-trained person. We propose that passive acoustic monitoring can be a cost-effective tool for in situ mapping of weakfish outside its natural distribution and an invaluable tool for early detection and to monitor its expansion. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Changes in the distribution of coastal macrophytes in Greenland, and elsewhere in the Arctic are difficult to quantify as the region remains challenging to access and monitor. Satellite imagery, in particular Sentinel-2 (S2), may enable large-scale monitoring of coastal areas in Greenland but its use is impacted by the optically complex environments and the scarcity of supporting data in the region. Additionally, the canopies of the dominant macrophyte species in Greenland do not extend to the sea surface, limiting the use of indices that exploit the reflection of near-infrared radiation by vegetation due to its absorption by seawater. Three hypotheses are tested: I) 10-m S2 imagery and commonly used detection methods can identify intertidal macrophytes that are exposed at low tide in an optically complex fjord system in Greenland impacted by marine and land terminating glaciers; II) detached and floating macrophytes accumulate in patches that are sufficiently large to be detected by 10-m S2 images; III) iceberg scour and/or turbid meltwater runoff shape the spatial distribution of intertidal macroalgae in fjord systems with marine-terminating glaciers. The NDVI produced the best results in optically complex fjord systems in Greenland. 12 km2 of exposed intertidal macrophytes were identified in the study area at low tide. Floating mats of macrophytes ranged in area from 400 m2 to 326,800 m2 and were most common at the mouth of the fjord. Icebergs and turbidity appear to play a role in structuring the distribution of intertidal macrophytes and the retreat of marine terminating glaciers could allow macrophytes cover to expand. The challenges and solutions presented here apply to most fjords in Greenland and, therefore, the methodology may be extended to produce a Greenland-wide estimate of intertidal macrophytes. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - We show that light trespass—a form of nighttime light pollution (NLP)—elicits normal daytime clock-mediated migratory behavior in fall monarch butterflies during their night-cycle. In controlled indoor flight simulator studies isolating the role of NLP on the expression of oriented migratory flight using a time-compensated sun compass,a full-spectrum light source consistent with lights used outdoors at night by the public,triggered proper fall directional flight at night in monarchs. Monarchs remained quiescent when initially placed in the flight simulator in the dark, but flight was immediately triggered when our light source was turned on. This nighttime behavior was identical to that seen in outdoor free-flying fall conspecifics during the day. The light source provided directional cues equivalent to those provided by the sun and could either phase-advance or phase-delay monarchs. Our study highlights the negative consequences of NLP on diurnal animals, especially those that rely on clock-mediated behavior. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Most soil quality measurements have been limited to laboratory-based methods that suffer from time delay, high cost, intensive labor requirement, discrete data collection, and tedious sample pretreatment. Real-time continuous soil monitoring (RTCSM) possesses a great potential to revolutionize field measurements by providing first-hand information for continuously tracking variations of heterogeneous soil parameters and diverse pollutants in a timely manner and thus enable constant updates essential for system control and decision-making. Through a systematic literature search and comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art RTCSM technologies, extensive discussion of their vital hurdles, and sharing of our future perspectives, this critical review bridges the knowledge gap of spatiotemporal uninterrupted soil monitoring and soil management execution. First, the barriers for reliable RTCSM data acquisition are elucidated by examining typical soil monitoring techniques (e.g., electrochemical and spectroscopic sensors). Next, the prevailing challenges of the RTCSM sensor network, data transmission, data processing, and personalized data management are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, this review explores RTCSM data application for updating diverse strategies including high-fidelity soil process models, control methodologies, digital soil mapping, soil degradation, food security, and climate change mitigation. Finally, the significance of RTCSM implementation in agricultural and environmental fields is underscored through illuminating future directions and perspectives in this systematic review. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Marine ecosystem dynamics in the context of climate change is a growing scientific, political and social concern requiring regular monitoring through appropriate observational technologies and studies. Thus, a wide range of tools comprising chemical, biogeochemical, physical, and biological sensors, as well as other platforms exists for marine monitoring. However, their high acquisition and maintenance costs are often a major obstacle, especially in low-income developing countries. We designed an advanced low-cost synoptic marine ecosystem observation system that operates at relatively high temporal frequencies, named PlasPi TDM. This instrument is an improved version of the camera system (PlasPI marine cameras) developed in 2020 by Autun Purser from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research (Germany), and collaborators. It incorporates several innovative developments such as multispectral (records the spectrum of any object photographed), temperature and pressure sensors. The PlasPi TDM operates to a depth of 200 m. The various field deployments demonstrate the operational capability of the PlasPi TDM for different applications and illustrate its considerable potential for in-situ observations and marine surveillance in Africa. This device is intended as an open-source project and its continued development is encouraged for a more integrated, sustainable and low-cost ocean observing system. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Robust monitoring data provides important information on ecosystem responses to anthropogenic stressors; however, traditional monitoring methodologies, which rely heavily on time in the field, are resource intensive. Consequently, trade-offs between data metrics captured and overall spatial and temporal coverage are necessary to fit within realistic monitoring budgets and timeframes. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have reduced the severity of these trade-offs by providing cost-effective, high-quality data at greatly increased temporal and spatial scales. Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, a form of remote sensing utilising numerous overlapping images, is well established in terrestrial applications and can be a key tool for monitoring changes in marine benthic ecosystems, which are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors. Diver-generated photomosaics, an output of SfM photogrammetry, are increasingly being used as a benthic monitoring tool in clear tropical waters, but their utility within temperate rocky reef ecosystems has received less attention. Here we compared benthic monitoring data collected from virtual quadrats placed on photomosaics with traditional diver-based field quadrats to understand the strengths and weaknesses of using photomosaics for monitoring temperate rocky reef ecosystems. In north-eastern New Zealand, we evaluated these methods at three sites where sea urchin barrens were prevalent. We found key metrics (sea urchin densities, macroalgae canopy cover and benthic community cover) were similar between the two methods, but data collected via photogrammetry were quicker, requiring significantly less field time and resources, and allowed greater spatial coverage than diver-based field quadrats. However, the use of photomosaics was limited by high macroalgal canopy cover, shallow water and rough sea state which reduced stitching success and obscured substratum and understory species. The results demonstrate that photomosaics can be used as a resource efficient and robust method for effectively assessing and monitoring key metrics on temperate rocky reef ecosystems.

AB  - The critical zone (CZ) includes natural and anthropogenic environments, where life, energy and matter cycles combine in complex interactions in time and space. Critical zone observatories (CZOs) have been established around the world, yet their limitations in space and duration of observations, as well as the oft-existing dominant disciplinary research field(s) of each CZO may limit the transferability of the local knowledge to other settings or hinder integrative CZ understanding. In this regard, this review advocates for cross-site cross-network collaborations in CZ sciences. We posit that this type of collaboration is becoming indispensable for understanding past trends and future trajectories of the CZ, in the context of fast-developing and widespread environmental changes. Aided by a series of cyberseminars and a community survey, we highlight some of the existing cross-site initiatives, tools and techniques, and the cross-cutting science questions that could benefit from such cross-network syntheses, in various types of CZ settings (montane, alpine, arctic, managed and agricultural environments, lakes, wetlands, streams, landscapes disturbed by drought and/or wildfire, etc.). This review also identifies and discusses the major and legitimate concerns and obstacles for a collaborative CZ approach, including data harmonization and integration of social sciences, and proposes tentative ways forward. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) are native to southeastern Asia, however, there is an established invasive population inhabiting much of southern Florida throughout the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. Pythons have severely impacted native species and ecosystems in Florida and represent one of the most intractable invasive-species management issues across the globe. The difficulty stems from a unique combination of inaccessible habitat and the cryptic and resilient nature of pythons that thrive in the subtropical environment of southern Florida, rendering them extremely challenging to detect. Here we provide a comprehensive review and synthesis of the science relevant to managing invasive Burmese pythons. We describe existing control tools and review challenges to productive research, identifying key knowledge gaps that would improve future research and decision making for python control. © 2023,NeoBiota.

AB  - Home to over 80 percent of all life on Earth, the ocean is the world’s largest carbon sink and a key source of food and economic security for billions of people. The relevance of the ocean for humanity's future is undisputed. However, the ocean’s great potential to drive economic growth and equitable job creation, sustain healthy ecosystems, and mitigate climate change is not yet fully recognised. Lack of awareness of this potential as well as management and governance challenges pose impediments. Until these impediments are removed, ocean ecosystems will continue to be degraded and opportunities for people lost. A transition and a clear path to a thriving and vibrant relationship between humans and the ocean are urgently needed. This open access collection of papers and reports identifies a path that is inspired by science, energised by engaged people, and emboldened by visionary leaders. These assessments of knowledge are commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), which was established in September 2018 as a unique initiative led by heads of state and government from around the world, to showcase the latest leading-edge science, knowledge and state-of-the-art thinking on key ocean issues. Altogether, The Blue Compendium offers innovative ocean solutions in technology, policy, governance, and finance realms, that could help accelerate a transition to a more sustainable and prosperous relationship with the ocean. The comprehensive assessments have already informed policy making at the highest levels of government and motivated an impressive array of responsive and ambitious action across a growing network of leaders in business, finance and civil society. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Vegetation phenology has been viewed as the nature's calendar and an integrative indicator of plant-climate interactions. The correct representation of vegetation phenology is important for models to accurately simulate the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between the vegetated land surface and the atmosphere. Remote sensing has advanced the monitoring of vegetation phenology by providing spatially and temporally continuous data that together with conventional ground observations offers a unique contribution to our knowledge about the environmental impact on ecosystems as well as the ecological adaptations and feedback to global climate change. Land surface phenology (LSP) is defined as the use of satellites to monitor seasonal dynamics in vegetated land surfaces and to estimate phenological transition dates. LSP, as an interdisciplinary subject among remote sensing, ecology, and biometeorology, has undergone rapid development over the past few decades. Recent advances in sensor technologies, as well as data fusion techniques, have enabled novel phenology retrieval algorithms that refine phenology details at even higher spatiotemporal resolutions, providing new insights into ecosystem dynamics. As such, here we summarize the recent advances in LSP and the associated opportunities for science applications. We focus on the remaining challenges, promising techniques, and emerging topics that together we believe will truly form the very frontier of the global LSP research field. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study presents the ongoing activities of citizen science (CS) monitoring of lake water quality that was developed in the SIMILE project. After presenting the tools and the initiatives that were implemented to gather volunteer contributions, the CS data are analyzed: to understand the main factors driving the contribution provided by citizens, through a proximity analysis using hierarchical clustering; to evaluate their added value and complementary nature in view of the proposed integrated lake monitoring with respect to remote sensing (RS) water quality parameters maps and in situ high-frequency monitoring (HFM) data that were acquired in the framework of SIMILE project, through an intercomparison of temperature data; and to highlight water quality patterns in the lakes under study. It is then discussed how the project outcomes could directly or indirectly contribute to the measurement of specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators highlighting the potential impact of CS activities. The conclusions highlight the complementary nature of CS and the need of supporting activities for a continuous lake water quality monitoring. The possibility for the partner local authorities to maintain the CS monitoring establishing a Citizen Observatory (CO) and the opportunity to extend the SIMILE approach to neighboring lakes and beyond is also discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. Unfortunately, researchers, agencies, and other management groups face the unresolved challenge of effectively detecting and monitoring IAS at large spatial and temporal scales. To improve the detection of soniferous IAS, we introduced a pipeline for large-scale passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Our main goal was to illustrate how PAM can be used to rapidly provide baseline information on soniferous IAS. To that aim, we collected acoustic data across Puerto Rico from March to June 2021 and used single-species occupancy models to investigate species distribution of species in the archipelago and to assess the peak of vocal activity. Overall, we detected 16 IAS (10 birds, 3 mammals, and 3 frogs) and 79 native species in an extensive data set with 1,773,287 1-min recordings. Avian activity peaked early in the morning (between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.), while amphibians peaked between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. Occupancy probability for IAS in Puerto Rico ranged from 0.002 to 0.67. In general, elevation and forest cover older than 54 years were negatively associated with IAS occupancy, corroborating our expectation that IAS occurrence is related to high levels of human disturbance and present higher occupancy probabilities in places characterized by more intense human activities. The work presented here demonstrates that PAM is a workable solution for monitoring vocally active IAS over a large area and provides a reproducible workflow that can be extended to allow for continued monitoring over longer timeframes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - High-resolution monitoring is fundamental to understand ecosystems dynamics in an era of global change and biodiversity declines. While real-time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components—for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution—is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high-throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology: the ability to rapidly generate high-resolution, multidimensional and standardised data across complex ecologies. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Water pollution is considered an acute worldwide environmental issue. At present, the commonly adopted method of water quality characterisation involves the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), but this method is subject to the limitation that understanding local scatter and absorption characteristics of light is essential to precisely derive these parameters. Water colour primarily depends on water constituents and is traditionally gauged with the Forel–Ule (FU) scale. In recent years, Rrs within the visible region has been considered to determine the Forel–Ule Index (FUI) for water colour measurement. The FUI exhibits the advantages of remote sensing and does not rely on local retrieval algorithms. Therefore, this index can characterise natural waters in a simple and globally effective manner. As there exists a lack of review articles on the FUI, we present a comprehensive review of this index that may help researchers progress. First, we introduce the most recent techniques for FUI measurement, especially remote sensing–deriving methods. Then, we summarise FUI applications in water quality assessment of oceans and inland waters. Finally, FUI development trends, challenges and application perspectives are examined. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Plastic litter has been widely documented in our oceans, leading to growing worldwide concerns regarding its potential impact on the marine environment. A large proportion of this plastic accumulates at the bottom of the ocean, resulting in a need to monitor and quantify seafloor litter. Seafloor litter monitoring is mostly performed using benthic beam trawls, which have several limitations and environmental implications. New innovative ways to document and address seafloor litter are therefore necessary and requested by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14.1.1b), the Oslo Paris Convention (OSPAR) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). This systematic review gives an overview of the state-of-the-art of 14 current underwater technologies that are eligible for future in situ detection of plastic litter on the seafloor based on 101 publications. A set of objectives and a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale were used to benchmark the technologies and revealed that the most suitable system is often very scenario-specific and, therefore, demands investments in more than one specific group of technologies. A decision tool was established to determine the most suitable technique for a range of different situations. This review indicates that most of these technologies are currently at low-middle TRLs, requiring several more development, testing and commercialization steps before they can be applied effectively in marine field conditions. However, these technologies, alone or in combination, have the potential to contribute to the establishment of more robust global environmental indicators and monitoring programs for plastic pollution. © 2023

AB  - Ocean biodiversity loss is being driven by several anthropogenic threats and significant efforts are required to halt losses and promote healthy marine ecosystems. The establishment of a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can help restrict damaging activities and have been recognised as a potential solution to aid marine conservation. When managed correctly they can deliver both ecological and socio-economic benefits. In recent times, MPA designations have increased rapidly while many countries have set future MPA targets for the decades ahead. An integral element of MPA management is adequate monitoring that collects data to assess if conservation objectives are being achieved. Data acquired by monitoring can vary widely as can the techniques employed to collect such data. Ideally, non-destructive and non-invasive methods are preferred to prevent damage to habitats and species, though this may rule out a number of traditional extractive sampling approaches such as dredges and trawls. Moreover, advances in ocean observation technologies enable the collection of large amounts of data at high resolutions, while automated data processing is beginning to make analyses more logistically feasible and less time-consuming. Therefore, developments to existing marine monitoring techniques and new emerging technologies have led to a diverse array of options when choosing to implement an MPA monitoring programme. Here, we present a review of new and existing non-extractive techniques which can be applied to MPA monitoring. We summarise their capabilities, applications, advantages, limitations and possible future developments. The review is intended to aid MPA managers and researchers in determining the suitability of available monitoring techniques based on data requirements and site conditions.

AB  - Biological traits analysis (BTA) links community structure to both ecological functions and response to environmental drivers through species’ attributes. In consequence, it has become a popular approach in marine benthic studies. However, BTA will reach a dead end if the scientific community does not acknowledge its current shortcomings and limitations: (a) uncertainties related to data origins and a lack of standardized reporting of trait information; (b) knowledge gaps on the role of multiple interacting traits on driving the organisms’ responses to environmental variability; (c) knowledge gaps regarding the mechanistic links between traits and functions; (d) a weak focus on the spatial and temporal variability that is inherent to the trait expression of species; and, last but not least, (e) the large reliance on expert knowledge due to an enormous knowledge gap on the basic ecology of many benthic species. BTA will only reach its full potential if the scientific community is able to standardize and unify the reporting and storage of traits data and reconsider the importance of baseline observational and experimental studies to fill knowledge gaps on the mechanistic links between biological traits, functions, and environmental variability. This challenge could be assisted by embracing new technological advances in marine monitoring, such as underwater camera technology and artificial intelligence, and making use of advanced statistical approaches that consider the interactive nature and spatio-temporal variability of biological systems. The scientific community has to abandon some dead ends and explore new paths that will improve our understanding of individual species, traits, and the functioning of benthic ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Monitoring biodiversity is paramount to manage and protect natural resources. Collecting images of organisms over large temporal or spatial scales is a promising practice to monitor the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, providing large amounts of data with minimal interference with the environment. Deep learning models are currently used to automate classification of organisms into taxonomic units. However, imprecision in these classifiers introduces a measurement noise that is difficult to control and can significantly hinder the analysis and interpretation of data. We overcome this limitation through ensembles of Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs), which not only are easy to train and implement, but also significantly outperform the previous state of the art (SOTA). We validate our results on ten ecological imaging datasets of diverse origin, ranging from plankton to birds. On all the datasets, we achieve a new SOTA, with a reduction of the error with respect to the previous SOTA ranging from 29.35% to 100.00%, and often achieving performances very close to perfect classification. Ensembles of DeiTs perform better not because of superior single-model performances but rather due to smaller overlaps in the predictions by independent models and lower top-1 probabilities. This increases the benefit of ensembling, especially when using geometric averages to combine individual learners. While we only test our approach on biodiversity image datasets, our approach is generic and can be applied to any kind of images. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The forestry sector has used technology to improve productivity and increase service quality, reducing labor in many processes. In this sense, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are having broad impacts on the forestry sector, from forestry to the marketing of forest products and the recreational use of forests. There is a wide range of technologies that can be implemented in forestry depending on the needs of each user. The objective of this study was to conduct a literature review in order to analyze the opportunities for improving ICT and communication flows in the forestry sector and to evaluate their applicability. This literature review was analyzed using the Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. An overview of the importance of ICT and communication flows in the forestry sector, ICT tools, and their applications is provided. One-way and two-way communication flows coexist in forestry, integrating different communication channels, time, target audience, and message. It is clear that technologies have produced significant changes in all sectors of the forestry industry. We conclude that ICTs and communication flows contribute to forest conservation and management in the establishment of standards or policies that ensure conservation through monitoring and analysis of landscapes at different temporal and spatial scales. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The cyber-agricultural system (CAS) represents an overarching framework of agriculture that leverages recent advances in ubiquitous sensing, artificial intelligence, smart actuators, and scalable cyberinfrastructure (CI) in both breeding and production agriculture. We discuss the recent progress and perspective of the three fundamental components of CAS – sensing, modeling, and actuation – and the emerging concept of agricultural digital twins (DTs). We also discuss how scalable CI is becoming a key enabler of smart agriculture. In this review we shed light on the significance of CAS in revolutionizing crop breeding and production by enhancing efficiency, productivity, sustainability, and resilience to changing climate. Finally, we identify underexplored and promising future directions for CAS research and development. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Atmospheric correction of satellite optical imagery over inland waters is a key remaining challenge in aquatic remote sensing. This is due to numerous confounding factors such as the com-plexity of water optical properties, the surface glint, the heterogeneous nature of atmospheric aero-sols, and the proximity of bright land surfaces. This combination of factors makes it difficult to re-trieve accurate information about the system observed. Moreover, the impact of radiance coming from adjacent land (adjacency effects) in complex geometries further adds to this challenge, especially for small lakes. In this study, ten atmospheric correction algorithms were evaluated for high-resolution multispectral imagery of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 MultiSpec-tral Instrument using in situ optical measurements from ~300 lakes across Canada. The results of the validation show that the performance of the algorithms varies by spectral band and evaluation metrics. The dark spectrum fitting algorithm had the best performance in terms of similarity angle (spectral shape), while the neural network-based models showed the lowest errors and bias per band. However, none of the tested atmospheric correction algorithms meet a 30% retrieval accuracy target across all the visible bands, likely due to uncorrected adjacency effects. To quantify this pro-cess, three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations were performed and compared to satellite observations. These simulations show that up to 60% of the top of atmosphere reflectance in the near-infrared bands over the lake was from the adjacent lands covered with green vegetation. The significance of these adjacency effects on atmospheric correction has been analyzed qualitatively, and potential efforts to improve the atmospheric correction algorithms are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The growing trend toward urbanisation and the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme weather events emphasise the need for further monitoring and understanding of weather in cities. In order to gain information on these intra-urban weather patterns, dense high-quality atmospheric measurements are needed. Crowdsourced weather stations (CWSs) could be a promising solution to realise such monitoring networks in a cost-efficient way. However, due to their nontraditional measuring equipment and installation settings, the quality of datasets from these networks remains an issue. This paper presents crowdsourced data from the "Leuven.cool"network, a citizen science network of around 100 low-cost weather stations (Fine Offset WH2600) distributed across Leuven, Belgium (50° 52′N, 4° 42′E). The dataset is accompanied by a newly developed station-specific temperature quality control (QC) and correction procedure. The procedure consists of three levels that remove implausible measurements while also correcting for inter-station (between-station) and intra-station (station-specific) temperature biases by means of a random forest approach. The QC method is evaluated using data from four WH2600 stations installed next to official weather stations belonging to the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI). A positive temperature bias with a strong relation to the incoming solar radiation was found between the CWS data and the official data. The QC method is able to reduce this bias from 0.15±0.56 to 0.00±0.28K. After evaluation, the QC method is applied to the data of the Leuven.cool network, making it a very suitable dataset to study local weather phenomena, such as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, in detail.

AB  - Monitoring vine water status is a major challenge for vineyard management because it influences both yield and harvest quality. It is also a challenge at the regional scale for identifying periods of high-water restriction or zones regularly impacted by water stress and changes of these impacts over the years. This information is interesting for defining collective strategies, anticipating harvest logistic issues or applying for irrigation authorisation. At this spatial scale, existing tools and methods for monitoring vine water status are few and often require strong assumptions and/or parameters to be defined exhaustively (e.g. water balance model). This paper proposes to consider a collaborative collection of observations by winegrowers and wine industry stakeholders (crowdsourcing) as an interesting alternative. Indeed, it allows the collection of a large number of field observations while pooling the collection effort. However, the feasibility of such a project and its interest in monitoring vine water status at regional scale has never been tested. The objective of the article is to explore the possibility of making a regional map of vine water status based on crowdsourcing observations. It is based on the free mobile application ApeX-Vigne, which allows the collection of observations of vine shoot growth. This information is easy to collect and can be considered, under certain conditions, as a proxy for vine water status. Nearly 5,000 observations were collected by winegrowers and wine industry stakeholders during 2019, 2020 and 2021 seasons. Vine shoot growth maps were derived from this dataset at regional scale and its ability to monitor temporal evolution of these maps was studied. This article also proposes an analysis of the factors that favoured the number of observations collected. These results open up new perspectives for monitoring vine water status at the regional scale, they also provide references for other crowdsourcing projects in viticulture. © 2022, International Viticulture and Enology Society.

AB  - SDMs are not new to conservation, but their popularity has increased dramatically in recent years. This step-by-step review provides an overview of the efficacy of SDMs in guiding restoration and conservation strategies across a wide range of ecological realms. Numerous studies have demonstrated the applicability of SDMs to various fields; however, their effectiveness has not been evaluated for a variety of ecosystems. Therefore, a survey and analysis of published work on the use of SDM in ecological rejuvenation and conservation from 2002 to 2023 (May) is conducted. The analysis found a total of 739 papers and the number of papers increased after 2016. The United States of America (135) had the most SDM implementations in conservation planning, followed by China (59), Australia (40), and other nations, according to the classification of the research area by country. In the model, Maxent (341) and in the areas, Forest (252) outperformed contenders for the number of papers published. This review will create a framework to aid in the following: (1) information about taxa and realms in need of protection, (2) selection of the best SDM approach according to study aim, focused species, and study area, and (3) supplemental techniques useful for better SDM output. In addition, it will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various fundamental SDM algorithms in the context of ecological conservation.

AB  - In times of urbanization and climate change, urban green spaces and their ecosystem services are pivotal for adapting to extreme weather events such as heat and drought. But what happens to the provision of ecosystem services when green spaces themselves are compromised by heat and drought? In this study, we assessed the air temperature regulation by two structurally distinct inner-city parks in Leipzig, Germany, that were strongly affected by the heat and drought periods in 2018 and 2019. We used a dense network of in-situ measurements and machine learning to create spatially explicit maps of air temperature distribution at a fine-scale neighborhood level for a 24 h period during the summer heat wave in 2019. The results showed that the larger, tree-dominated park could maintain spaces of relative coolness at any time, whereas the other rather open, grass-dominated park was strongly heated during the daytime but provided relatively cool air during the night and early morning. We found a maximum spatially averaged cooling effect of green spaces versus the built-up surroundings of 1.1°C in the morning. In the afternoon, however, when air temperatures peaked at nearly 40°C, cooling was limited to shaded areas, leading to average differences between green spaces and built-up surroundings below 1°C. Our spatially explicit maps indicated that the “cooling distances” of green spaces, i.e., cooling effects that extend beyond the boundaries of a park, are negligible during dry and hot conditions. We conclude that vegetation structure, particularly the configuration of trees, is key to designing heat and drought-resilient green spaces and thus maintaining ecosystem service provision under the challenges of climate change. Urban planning needs to account for larger green spaces that are complemented by decentralized, well-distributed small-scale green infrastructure that intersperses the built infrastructure such as roadside greenery and vegetated backyards.

AB  - We provide the first comprehensive analysis of spatial heterogeneity in water quality across the Canadian nearshore regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes (LGL) with periodic sampling in the ice-free seasons from 2000 to 2019 for 24 water quality variables from 52 nearshore sites. We asked: (1) What is the extent, range, and magnitude of spatial heterogeneity in water quality conditions across the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes? and (2) How do features of anthropogenic development, sub-basin characteristics, anticipated coastal circulation, and weather influence water quality conditions in the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes? Principal Components Analysis explained 42% of the variation in water quality across the Canadian Great Lakes, with high spatial heterogeneity both within and among lakes, ranging from oligotrophic conditions in Lake Superior to eutrophic conditions in Lake Erie. Lakes Erie and Ontario generally had higher concentrations of chloride, chlorophyll a, and nutrients while higher silicate concentrations were observed in Lake Superior. Consistent patterns of degraded water quality were observed in Areas of Concern, such as Hamilton Harbour, Bay of Quinte, Nipigon Bay, and near Thunder Bay. Across the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes, regions with warmer air temperatures, in addition to urbanized and agricultural landscapes, were associated with deteriorated water quality. Our study highlights the importance of improving management practices across urban and agricultural landscapes, particularly in consideration of climatic change cumulatively degrading water quality conditions in the highly biologically, culturally, and socioeconomically important nearshore regions of the LGL. © 2023

AB  - Participatory citizen sensing (PCS) systems are a particular type of information system covering different activities of citizens, in which they actively report some problem they witnessed or just gather and share data about any phenomenon. Participatory citizen sensing supports transformation in the relationship between citizens and public sector organizations. For individuals, it became much easier to contribute, engage, and provide feedback. On the other hand, it is a cheap and fast way to gather data about a given topic for public sector organizations. This chapter aims to bring a comprehensive and systematic view of the PCS, showing what issues have to be solved to get the expected outcomes. Mainly, it answers these three questions: (1) in which areas PCS are used, (2) how citizens are recruited and motivated, and (3) what technical issues must be solved. To get a more realistic look at PCS, a portion of the chapter is devoted to one type of PCS – Citizen Reporting of Issues on Public Infrastructure (CRIsPI). This part introduces the study evaluating reporting systems used at the level of regional capitals in the Czech Republic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Processes that drive plant invasions play out across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding individual steps along the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum and its drivers is crucial for management. This review, targeting the broad audience of invasion scientists, field ecologists and land managers, summarizes the state-of-the-art and potential of remote sensing (RS) in plant invasion science and management. It identifies challenges and research gaps, discusses the discrepancies between technology, science and practice, and suggests ways of addressing some of these issues. Mapping, modelling and predicting invasion processes across scales is a major challenge since they are dynamic and highly complex. Integration of RS data collected at different spatial and temporal scales (“rocking” across scales) has the potential to elucidate the dynamics of invasions and to reveal its drivers, thereby improving the efficiency of control measures. Increasing spatial/temporal resolution of imagery from satellites and drones has much potential to (i) precisely identify even less conspicuous invasive species; (ii) map invasion dynamics; and (iii) provide information on environmental variables and landscape structure at scales fine enough to capture underlying ecological processes. Until now, RS research has focussed primarily on spatio-temporal patterns of plant invasions. Other more challenging topics, such as early monitoring, and revealing the invasion mechanisms and impacts have received less attention. Despite the power of RS technology and recent developments, large discrepancies remain between possibilities and actual implications in research and practical management of invasions. Although recent technological advances, such as powerful algorithms, cloud solutions, and data streams from citizen science, might overcome some limitations, the mutual dialog among field ecologists, managers, invasion scientists and RS specialists remains crucial; our review contributes to such communication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The recent increase in public and academic interest in preserving biodiversity has led to the growth of the field of conservation technology. This field involves designing and constructing tools that use technology to aid in the conservation of wildlife. In this review, we present five case studies and infer a framework for designing conservation tools (CT) based on human-wildlife interaction. Successful CT range in complexity from cat collars to machine learning and game theory methodologies and do not require technological expertise to contribute to conservation tool creation. Our goal is to introduce researchers to the field of conservation technology and provide references for guiding the next generation of conservation technologists. Conservation technology not only has the potential to benefit biodiversity but also has broader impacts on fields such as sustainability and environmental protection.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems can be mapped using RS because this technique is versatile and accurate. The availability of seagrass information is very important for the sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. The use of RS technology to map seagrass has become the focus of many researches worldwide by using various types of platforms, sensors and various algorithms for satellite imagery processing. In literature, there have been many review papers related to seagrass, however, a comprehensive review on various aspects of seagrass is limited. The objective of this review paper was to fill the gap by highlighting the existing RS technology, seagrass biophysical property and image processing analysis. Review results indicated that RS technology is a powerful tool for accelerating seagrass mapping and for monitoring the condition of seagrass ecosystems at regional scale due to the availability of long-archived RS data and their free-access. In literature, the empirical approaches still dominated seagrass mapping methodology compared to the semi-analytic and analytic approaches. A clear conclusion from this review is that the development in sensor technology and data processing algorithm is still ongoing and has driven RS capabilities to map seagrass more rapidly, accurately and less expensive. Future research on seagrass mapping could be focused on a more automated classification by applying machine-learning to handle a large amount of data to improve accuracy and to discover robust methods for image pre-processing that is suitable for tropical shallow waters such as those in Indonesia. © 2022 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are a rising threat to biodiversity, national security, and regional economies, with impacts in the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars annually. Proactive or predictive approaches guided by scientific knowledge are essential to keeping pace with growing impacts of invasions under climate change. Although the rapid development of diverse technologies and approaches has produced tools with the potential to greatly accelerate invasion research and management, innovation has far outpaced implementation and coordination. Technological and methodological syntheses are urgently needed to close the growing implementation gap and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and synergy among evolving disciplines. A broad review is necessary to demonstrate the utility and relevance of work in diverse fields to generate actionable science for the ongoing invasion crisis. Here, we review such advances in relevant fields including remote sensing, epidemiology, big data analytics, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, genomics, and others, and present a generalized framework for distilling existing and emerging data into products for proactive IAS research and management. This integrated workflow provides a pathway for scientists and practitioners in diverse disciplines to contribute to applied invasion biology in a coordinated, synergistic, and scalable manner. © 2022 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Although reflectometry is not the primary application of Global Positioning System (GPS) and similar Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), fast-growing GNSS tracking networks has led to the emergence of GNSS interferometric reflectometry technique for monitoring surface changes such as water level. However, scientific-grade or geodetic GNSS instruments are expensive, which is a limiting factor for their prompt and more widespread deployment as a dedicated environmental sensor. We present a prototype called Raspberry Pi Reflector (RPR) that includes a low-cost and low-maintenance single-frequency GPS module and a navigation antenna connected to an inexpensive Raspberry Pi microcomputer. A unit has been successfully operating for almost 2 years since March 2020 in Wesel (Germany) next to the Rhine river. Sub-daily and daily water levels are retrieved using spectral analysis of reflection data. The river level measurements from RPR are compared with a co-located river gauge. We find an Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 7.6 cm in sub-daily estimates and 6 cm in daily means of river level. In August 2021, we changed the antenna orientation from upright to sideways facing the river. The RMSE reduced to 3 cm (sub-daily) and 1.5 cm (daily) with the new orientation. While satellite radar altimetry techniques have been utilized to monitor water levels with global coverage, their measurements are associated with moderate uncertainties and temporal resolution. Therefore, such low-cost and high-precision instruments can be paired with satellite data for calibrating, validating and modeling purposes. These instruments are financially (<US$ 150 as of November 2021) and technically accessible worldwide. © 2022. The Authors.

AB  - Dive computers have the potential to provide depth resolved temperature data that is often lacking especially in close to shore, but spatiotemporal assessment of the robustness of this citizen science approach has not been done. In this study, we provide this assessment for the Red Sea, one of the most dived areas in the world. A comparison was conducted between 17 years of minimum water temperatures collected from SCUBA dive computers in the northern Red Sea (23–30° N, 32–39.4° E), satellite-derived sea surface temperatures from the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) optimal interpolation product, and depth-banded monthly mean in-situ temperature from the TEMPERSEA dataset, which incorporates data originating from several in-situ recording platforms (including Argo floats, ships and gliders). We show that dive computer temperature data clearly resolve seasonal patterns, which are in good agreement in both phase and amplitude with OSTIA and TEMPERSEA. On average, dive computer temperatures had an overall negative bias of (–0.5 ± 1.1) °C compared with OSTIA and (–0.2 ± 1.4) °C compared with TEMPERSEA. As may be expected, increased depth-related biases were found to be associated with stratified periods and shallower mixed layer depths, i.e., stronger vertical temperature gradients. A south-north temperature gradient consistent with values reported in the literature was also identifiable. Bias remains consistent even when subsampling just 1% of the total 9310 dive computer datapoints. We conclude that dive computers offer potential as an alternative source of depth-resolved temperatures to complement existing in situ and satellite SST data sources.

AB  - The protection and restoration of the biosphere is crucial for human resilience and well-being, but the scarcity of data on the status and distribution of biodiversity puts these efforts at risk. DNA released into the environment by organisms, i.e., environmental DNA (eDNA), can be used to monitor biodiversity in a scalable manner if equipped with the appropriate tool. However, the collection of eDNA in terrestrial environments remains a challenge because of the many potential surfaces and sources that need to be surveyed and their limited accessibility. Here, we propose to survey biodiversity by sampling eDNA on the outer branches of tree canopies with an aerial robot. The drone combines a force-sensing cage with a haptic-based control strategy to establish and maintain contact with the upper surface of the branches. Surface eDNA is then collected using an adhesive surface integrated in the cage of the drone. We show that the drone can autonomously land on a variety of branches with stiffnesses between 1 and 103 newton/meter without prior knowledge of their structural stiffness and with robustness to linear and angular misalignments. Validation in the natural environment demonstrates that our method is successful in detecting animal species, including arthropods and vertebrates. Combining robotics with eDNA sampling from a variety of unreachable aboveground substrates can offer a solution for broad-scale monitoring of biodiversity.  ©2023 The Authors, some rights reserved.

AB  - Science is essential to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) mission to protect human health and the environment. EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) provides the scientific bases for regulatory and public health policies that have broad impacts on the nation’s natural resources and quality of human life and that yield economic benefits and incur compliance costs for the regulated community. In addition, ORD develops the agency’s core research capabilities, providing tools and methods that can be applied to address complex environmental challenges. ORD research aids in the development of responses to emerging threats, provides scientific methods for ecological and human health risk assessment, and serves as a national and international resource for the advancement of environmental science. Those activities require the integration of scientific evidence across many disciplines including biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, toxicology, air quality, water quality, exposure science, social science, and environmental health. Meeting the agency’s research needs is complicated by EPA’s regulatory role in often controversial policy decisions and challenged by ORD’s steadily declining budgets and workforce capacity. As a part of fulfilling its role, ORD conducts innovative and forward-looking research that improves EPA’s capability of addressing emerging, complex environmental problems. It pursues that endeavor while meeting the need for reactive, problem-driven research to support EPA’s implementation of statutory requirements and other decision-making. ORD recognizes that continued accomplishment of EPA’s mission requires research that anticipates the most challenging problems, develops and adapts emerging scientific tools, and identifies and implements innovative solutions. In that light, ORD asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to form a committee to identify emerging scientific and technological advances from across a broad range of disciplines, such as environmental monitoring and data science, that ORD should consider in its research planning to support EPA’s mission, provide advice on how ORD might strategically position its research and development enterprise to anticipate and respond to the future research needs of the agency, and consider advances that help EPA better incorporate systems thinking into interdisciplinary approaches. © 2023 by the National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Climate change represents one of the most critical threats to biodiversity with far-reaching consequences for species interactions, the functioning of ecosystems, or the assembly of biotic communities. Plant phenology research has gained increasing attention as the timing of periodic events in plants is strongly affected by seasonal and interannual climate variation. Recent technological development allowed us to gather invaluable data at a variety of spatial and ecological scales. The feasibility of phenological monitoring today and in the future depends heavily on developing tools capable of efficiently analyzing these enormous amounts of data. Deep Neural Networks learn representations from data with impressive accuracy and lead to significant breakthroughs in, e.g., image processing. This article is the first systematic literature review aiming to thoroughly analyze all primary studies on deep learning approaches in plant phenology research. In a multi-stage process, we selected 24 peer-reviewed studies published in the last five years (2016–2021). After carefully analyzing these studies, we describe the applied methods categorized according to the studied phenological stages, vegetation type, spatial scale, data acquisition- and deep learning methods. Furthermore, we identify and discuss research trends and highlight promising future directions. We present a systematic overview of previously applied methods on different tasks that can guide this emerging complex research field. Copyright © 2022 Katal, Rzanny, Mäder and Wäldchen.

AB  - Ocean scientists studying diverse organisms and phenomena increasingly rely on imaging devices for their research. These scientists have many tools to collect their data, but few resources for automated analysis. In this paper, we report on discussions with diverse stakeholders to identify community needs and develop a set of functional requirements for the ongoing development of ocean science-specific analysis tools. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with individuals working in the Blue Economy space, revealing four central issues inhibiting the development of effective imaging analysis monitoring tools for marine science. We also identified twelve user archetypes that will engage with these services. Additionally, we held a workshop with 246 participants from 35 countries centered around FathomNet, a web-based open-source annotated image database for marine research. Findings from these discussions are being used to define the feature set and interface design of Ocean Vision AI, a suite of tools and services to advance observational capabilities of life in the ocean. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Evidence-based environmental management is urgently required to enable progress towards global conservation commitments. To fill large-scale biodiversity knowledge gaps, governments, organisations and communities must adopt innovative ecological monitoring techniques. The emergence of environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods, as well as the increased availability of in situ ocean observation and satellite remote sensing data, offers opportunities to overcome significant logistic and financial challenges previously associated with traditional biodiversity monitoring. Here, a 1.5 year-long eDNA survey reveals the spatial and temporal presence of ‘critically endangered’ scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) in Apra Harbor, Guam. The survey confirms the presence of S. lewini in the region, and shows eDNA detections are most frequent at the beginning of the dry season, in January. Combined analysis of eDNA results with open (freely available) ecological data identifies that S. lewini presence is associated with increases in water velocity, turbidity and wind direction, as well as decreases in temperature and wind speed. Additionally, the data indicate S. lewini are most frequent at sampling sites characterised by high turbidity, shallow depths, and large distances from the harbor entrance. Information on local distribution and habitat preferences generated here is fundamental to the establishment of management protocols that aim to minimise negative anthropogenic impacts on S. lewini in Apra Harbor. The work provides an example of contemporary marine monitoring for the efficient generation of biodiversity data; an approach that will enable informed management decisions and help to reduce the risk and rate of species extinctions throughout the next decade. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Context: Coral reef resilience is the product of multiple interacting processes that occur across various interacting scales. This complexity presents challenges for identifying solutions to the ongoing worldwide decline of coral reef ecosystems that are threatened by both local and global human stressors. Objectives: We highlight how coral reef resilience is studied at spatial, temporal, and functional scales, and explore emerging technologies that are bringing new insights to our understanding of reef resilience. We then provide a framework for integrating insights across scales by using new and existing technological and analytical tools. We also discuss the implications of scale on both the ecological processes that lead to declines of reefs, and how we study those mechanisms. Methods: To illustrate, we present a case study from Kāneʻohe Bay, Hawaiʻi, USA, linking remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery to within-colony symbiont communities that show differential responses to stress. Results: In doing so, we transform the scale at which we can study coral resilience from a few individuals to entire ecosystems. Conclusions: Together, these perspectives guide best practices for designing management solutions that scale from individuals to ecosystems by integrating multiple levels of biological organization from cellular processes to global patterns of coral degradation and resilience. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Due to the semi-enclosed nature of the Mediterranean Sea, natural disasters and anthropogenic activities impose stronger pressures on its coastal ecosystems than in any other sea of the world. With the aim of responding adequately to science priorities and societal challenges, littoral waters must be effectively monitored with high-frequency radar (HFR) systems. This land-based remote sensing technology can provide, in near-real time, fine-resolution maps of the surface circulation over broad coastal areas, along with reliable directional wave and wind information. The main goal of this work is to showcase the current status of the Mediterranean HFR network and the future roadmap for orchestrated actions. Ongoing collaborative efforts and recent progress of this regional alliance are not only described but also connected with other European initiatives and global frameworks, highlighting the advantages of this cost-effective instrument for the multi-parameter monitoring of the sea state. Coordinated endeavors between HFR operators from different multi-disciplinary institutions are mandatory to reach a mature stage at both national and regional levels, striving to do the following: (i) harmonize deployment and maintenance practices; (ii) standardize data, metadata, and quality control procedures; (iii) centralize data management, visualization, and access platforms; and (iv) develop practical applications of societal benefit that can be used for strategic planning and informed decision-making in the Mediterranean marine environment. Such fit-for-purpose applications can serve for search and rescue operations, safe vessel navigation, tracking of marine pollutants, the monitoring of extreme events, the investigation of transport processes, and the connectivity between offshore waters and coastal ecosystems. Finally, future prospects within the Mediterranean framework are discussed along with a wealth of socioeconomic, technical, and scientific challenges to be faced during the implementation of this integrated HFR regional network. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - With the booming development of information technology and the growing demand for remote sensing data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has emerged. In recent years, UAV remote sensing technology has developed rapidly and has been widely used in the fields of military defense, agricultural monitoring, surveying and mapping management, and disaster and emergency response and management. Currently, increasingly serious marine biological and environmental problems are raising the need for effective and timely monitoring. Compared with traditional marine monitoring technologies, UAV remote sensing is becoming an important means for marine monitoring thanks to its flexibility, efficiency and low cost, while still producing systematic data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study visualizes the knowledge domain of the application and research advances of UAV remote sensing in marine monitoring by analyzing 1130 articles (from 1993 to early 2022) using a bibliometric approach and provides a review of the application of UAVs in marine management mapping, marine disaster and environmental monitoring, and marine wildlife monitoring. It aims to promote the extensive application of UAV remote sensing in the field of marine research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, advancements in remote and proximal sensing technology have driven innovation in environmental and land surveys. The integration of various geomatics devices, such as reflex and UAVs equipped with RGB cameras and mobile laser scanners (MLS), allows detailed and precise surveys of monumental trees. With these data fusion method, we reconstructed three monumental 3D tree models, allowing the computation of tree metric variables such as diameter at breast height (DBH), total height (TH), crown basal area (CBA), crown volume (CV) and wood volume (WV), even providing information on the tree shape and its overall conditions. We processed the point clouds in software such as CloudCompare, 3D Forest, R and MATLAB, whereas the photogrammetric processing was conducted with Agisoft Metashape. Three-dimensional tree models enhance accessibility to the data and allow for a wide range of potential applications, including the development of a tree information model (TIM), providing detailed data for monitoring tree health, growth, biomass and carbon sequestration. The encouraging results provide a basis for extending the virtualization of these monumental trees to a larger scale for conservation and monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The Arctic is warming at a faster rate than any other biome on Earth, resulting in widespread changes in vegetation composition, structure and function that have important feedbacks to the global climate system. The heterogeneous nature of arctic landscapes creates challenges for monitoring and improving understanding of these ecosystems, as current efforts typically rely on ground, airborne or satellite-based observations that are limited in space, time or pixel resolution. The use of remote sensing instruments on small unoccupied aerial systems (UASs) has emerged as an important tool to bridge the gap between detailed, but spatially limited ground-level measurements, and lower resolution, but spatially extensive high-altitude airborne and satellite observations. UASs allow researchers to view, describe and quantify vegetation dynamics at fine spatial scales (1–10 cm) over areas much larger than typical field plots. UASs can be deployed with a high degree of temporal flexibility, enabling observation across diurnal, seasonal and annual time-scales. Here we review how established and emerging UAS remote sensing technologies can enhance arctic plant ecological research by quantifying fine-scale vegetation patterns and processes, and by enhancing the ability to link ground-based measurements with broader-scale information obtained from airborne and satellite platforms. Synthesis. Improved ecological understanding and model representation of arctic vegetation is needed to forecast the fate of the Arctic in a rapidly changing climate. Observations from UASs provide an approach to address this need, however, the use of this technology in the Arctic currently remains limited. Here we share recommendations to better enable and encourage the use of UASs to improve the description, scaling and model representation of arctic vegetation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technologies (such as airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles and terrestrial sensors) as surveillance tools to monitor the environment exposes firms, industry sectors and national economies to new levels of transparency. The veracity and timeliness of remote sensing technologies outpaces the surveillance capabilities of existing monitoring and reporting practices in organisations and their supply chains – which are often based on in situ observations and operated through processes that were largely developed in the pre-internet era. This paper provides a conceptual analysis of the impact of remote sensing on conformance systems (also referred to as assurance systems) – an infrastructure that is typical for standards, monitoring and reporting mechanisms such as ISO 14001, the GRI or ESG. The analysis is grounded against a backdrop of the Eco-index (a cross-disciplinary scientific initiative in New Zealand) that develops a surveillance system to monitor biodiversity. The socio-technical perspective is used as the theoretical underpinning. A conceptual analysis demonstrates that conformance systems need to undergo a transformational change. This change is discussed in the paper in terms of the critical socio-technical components (technological, actors, task and structure) that are needed to transform and align with the needs of the digital economy. © 2023

AB  - This paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in Chilean temperate forests which extend along western South America from latitude 29° S to 56° S. This geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation, edaphic, topographic, geologic, and climatic settings which create a unique natural laboratory. Many local communities, endangered freshwater ecosystems, and downstream economic activities in Chile rely on water flows from forested catchments. This review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of Chilean forest hydrology, to (ii) review prior research in forest hydrology in Chile, and to (iii) identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in Chile. We reviewed the relation between native forests, commercial plantations, and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale. Much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here. Streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting, native forests appear to use less water than plantations, and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland/shrublands. We identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems, soil–plant-atmosphere interactions, native forest hydrology, and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology. Also, we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types (35-36°S); most forest hydrology studies in Chile (56%) have been conducted in the southern area (Los Rios Region around 39-40° S). There is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover. There is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process-based investigations linking field studies and modeling. Through the establishment of a forest hydrology science “society” to coordinate efforts, regional and national-scale land use planning might be supported. Our review ends with a vision to advance a cross-scale collaborative effort to use new nation-wide catchment-scale networks Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) sites, to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies, and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in Chile. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Antarctic ecosystems are under increasing anthropogenic pressure, but efforts to predict the responses of Antarctic biodiversity to environmental change are hindered by considerable data challenges. Here, we illustrate how novel data capture technologies provide exciting opportunities to sample Antarctic biodiversity at wider spatiotemporal scales. Data integration frameworks, such as point process and hierarchical models, can mitigate weaknesses in individual data sets, improving confidence in their predictions. Increasing process knowledge in models is imperative to achieving improved forecasts of Antarctic biodiversity, which can be attained for data-limited species using hybrid modelling frameworks. Leveraging these state-of-the-art tools will help to overcome many of the data scarcity challenges presented by the remoteness of Antarctica, enabling more robust forecasts both near- and long-term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the field of Earth observation, the importance of in situ data was recognized by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) in the Canberra Declaration in 2019. The GEO community focuses on three global priority engagement areas: the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. While efforts have been made by GEO to open and disseminate in situ data, GEO did not have a general way to capture in situ data user requirements and drive the data provider efforts to meet the goals of its three global priorities. We present a requirements data model that first formalizes the collection of user requirements motivated by user-driven needs. Then, the user requirements can be grouped by essential variable and an analysis can derive product requirements and parameters for new or existing products. The work was inspired by thematic initiatives, such as OSCAR, from WMO, OSAAP (formerly COURL and NOSA) from NOAA, and the Copernicus In Situ Component Information System. The presented solution focuses on requirements for all applications of Earth observation in situ data. We present initial developments and testing of the data model and discuss the steps that GEO should take to implement a requirements database that is connected to actual data in the GEOSS platform and propose some recommendations on how to articulate it. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Monitoring ephemeral and intermittent streams is a major challenge in hydrology. On-site inspections may be impractical in difficult-to-access environments. Motivated by the latest advancements in digital cameras and computer vision techniques, in this work, we describe the development and application of a stage-camera system to monitor the water level in ungauged headwater streams. The system encompasses a consumer-grade wildlife camera with near-infrared (NIR) night vision capabilities and a white pole that serves as reference object in the collected images. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a set of benchmark experiments performed in natural settings. Maximum mean absolute errors between stage-camera and reference data are approximately equal to 2 cm in the worst scenario that corresponds to severe storms with intense rainfall and fog. Our preliminary results are encouraging and support the scalability of the stage-camera in future implementations in a wide range of natural settings. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Multifunctional and diversified agriculture can address diverging pressures and demands by simultaneously enhancing productivity, biodiversity, and the provision of ecosystem services. The use of digital technologies can support this by designing and managing resource-efficient and context-specific agricultural systems. We present the Digital Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (DAKIS) to demonstrate an approach that employs digital technologies to enable decision-making towards diversified and sustainable agriculture. To develop the DAKIS, we specified, together with stakeholders, requirements for a knowledge-based decision-support tool and reviewed the literature to identify limitations in the current generation of tools. The results of the review point towards recurring challenges regarding the consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the capacity to foster communication and cooperation between farmers and other actors, and the ability to link multiple spatiotemporal scales and sustainability levels. To overcome these challenges, the DAKIS provides a digital platform to support farmers' decision-making on land use and management via an integrative spatiotemporally explicit approach that analyses a wide range of data from various sources. The approach integrates remote and in situ sensors, artificial intelligence, modelling, stakeholder-stated demand for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and participatory sustainability impact assessment to address the diverse drivers affecting agricultural land use and management design, including natural and agronomic factors, economic and policy considerations, and socio-cultural preferences and settings. Ultimately, the DAKIS embeds the consideration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainability into farmers' decision-making and enables learning and progress towards site-adapted small-scale multifunctional and diversified agriculture while simultaneously supporting farmers' objectives and societal demands. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Globally, pests (invertebrates, vertebrates, pathogens, weeds) can cause estimated annual losses of between 20% and 40%, but higher losses are disproportionately experienced by many low-income countries, as agriculture is the mainstay of the majority of the people and of national economies. Pests pose a major barrier to these countries’ ability to meet the aims of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG2, “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.” However, solutions, in the form of pest risk alert systems, coupled with major advances in technology, are now providing opportunities to overcome this barrier in low-income countries. In this paper, we review these systems and the advances in data availability, management and modeling and communication technology and illustrate how these can provide new and novel solutions for the development of agricultural pest and disease early warning and risk-mapping systems and contribute to improved food systems in low-income countries. In conclusion, we identify key areas for the UNFSS that will help guide governments in engaging with these developments. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Due to anthropogenic actions, the presence of pollutants in water bodies, such as toxic metals, are increasingly negatively affecting water quality, biodiversity and sustainable goals worldwide. Therefore, decentralization of water pollution monitoring with low-cost devices, such as using smartphones, suggests an innovative green technology for in situ and real-time control. In this study, a Handheld Smartphone Spectrophotometry System (HSSS) was developed to estimate copper and iron concentration water samples. The system mainly comprises a portable commercial spectrometer (GoSpectro) that can measure the spectrum of light in the visible region. The HSSS LOD and LOQ for copper were equal to 0.589 and 1.784 mg/L, respectively, and 0.479 and 1.450 mg/L, respectively for iron. In addition, the results of copper and iron concentrations in samples with unknown concentrations using HSSS were close to the Benchtop Spectrophometer (BS). Finally, HSSS performance showed to be a new green technology for water quality management with potential applications for monitoring water resources and also providing further possibilities to measure other pollutants by the same technique, in addition to metals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generalization to novel domains is a fundamental chal-lenge for computer vision. Near-perfect accuracy on bench-marks is common, but these models do not work as expected when deployed outside of the training distribution. To build computer vision systems that truly solve real-world prob-lems at global scale, we need benchmarks that fully capture real-world complexity, including geographic domain shift, long-tailed distributions, and data noise. We propose urban forest monitoring as an ideal testbed for studying and improving upon these computer vision challenges, while working towards filling a crucial environ-mental and societal need. Urban forests provide significant benefits to urban societies. However, planning and main-taining these forests is expensive. One particularly costly aspect of urban forest management is monitoring the ex-isting trees in a city: e.g., tracking tree locations, species, and health. Monitoring efforts are currently based on tree censuses built by human experts, costing cities millions of dollars per census and thus collected infrequently. Previous investigations into automating urban forest monitoring focused on small datasets from single cities, covering only common categories. To address these short-comings, we introduce a new large-scale dataset that joins public tree censuses from 23 cities with a large collection of street level and aerial imagery. Our Auto Arborist dataset contains over 2.5M trees and 344 genera and is >2 or-ders of magnitude larger than the closest dataset in the literature. We introduce baseline results on our dataset across modalities as well as metrics for the detailed analy-sis of generalization with respect to geographic distribution shifts, vital for such a system to be deployed at-scale. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) refers to computer algorithms that predict a meaningful output or categorize complex systems based on a large amount of data. ML is applied in various areas including natural science, engineering, space exploration, and even gaming development. This review focuses on the use of machine learning in the field of chemical and biological oceanography. In the prediction of global fixed nitrogen levels, partial carbon dioxide pressure, and other chemical properties, the application of ML is a promising tool. Machine learning is also utilized in the field of biological oceanography to detect planktonic forms from various images (i.e., microscopy, FlowCAM, and video recorders), spectrometers, and other signal processing techniques. Moreover, ML successfully classified the mammals using their acoustics, detecting endangered mammalian and fish species in a specific environment. Most importantly, using environmental data, the ML proved to be an effective method for predicting hypoxic conditions and harmful algal bloom events, an essential measurement in terms of environmental monitoring. Furthermore, machine learning was used to construct a number of databases for various species that will be useful to other researchers, and the creation of new algorithms will help the marine research community better comprehend the chemistry and biology of the ocean. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This review provides a community's perspective on air quality research focusing mainly on developments over the past decade. The article provides perspectives on current and future challenges as well as research needs for selected key topics. While this paper is not an exhaustive review of all research areas in the field of air quality, we have selected key topics that we feel are important from air quality research and policy perspectives. After providing a short historical overview, this review focuses on improvements in characterizing sources and emissions of air pollution, new air quality observations and instrumentation, advances in air quality prediction and forecasting, understanding interactions of air quality with meteorology and climate, exposure and health assessment, and air quality management and policy. In conducting the review, specific objectives were (i) to address current developments that push the boundaries of air quality research forward, (ii) to highlight the emerging prominent gaps of knowledge in air quality research, and (iii) to make recommendations to guide the direction for future research within the wider community. This review also identifies areas of particular importance for air quality policy. The original concept of this review was borne at the International Conference on Air Quality 2020 (held online due to the COVID 19 restrictions during 18-26 May 2020), but the article incorporates a wider landscape of research literature within the field of air quality science. On air pollution emissions the review highlights, in particular, the need to reduce uncertainties in emissions from diffuse sources, particulate matter chemical components, shipping emissions, and the importance of considering both indoor and outdoor sources. There is a growing need to have integrated air pollution and related observations from both ground-based and remote sensing instruments, including in particular those on satellites. The research should also capitalize on the growing area of low-cost sensors, while ensuring a quality of the measurements which are regulated by guidelines. Connecting various physical scales in air quality modelling is still a continual issue, with cities being affected by air pollution gradients at local scales and by long-range transport. At the same time, one should allow for the impacts from climate change on a longer timescale. Earth system modelling offers considerable potential by providing a consistent framework for treating scales and processes, especially where there are significant feedbacks, such as those related to aerosols, chemistry, and meteorology. Assessment of exposure to air pollution should consider the impacts of both indoor and outdoor emissions, as well as application of more sophisticated, dynamic modelling approaches to predict concentrations of air pollutants in both environments. With particulate matter being one of the most important pollutants for health, research is indicating the urgent need to understand, in particular, the role of particle number and chemical components in terms of health impact, which in turn requires improved emission inventories and models for predicting high-resolution distributions of these metrics over cities. The review also examines how air pollution management needs to adapt to the above-mentioned new challenges and briefly considers the implications from the COVID-19 pandemic for air quality. Finally, we provide recommendations for air quality research and support for policy.  © Copyright:

AB  - The amount of plastics on seawater is causing ecosystem damage to both land areas and water bodies. It is proven that once plastic particles reach the sea, they will be degraded. As their detection is not easy with in situ sampling, remote sensing techniques could help detect and evaluate their impact on ecosystems. To understand the main limitations of detecting floating plastic material through remote images, an a pilot experiment was carried out on an artificial floating plastic target deployed at the Aegean Sea (Greece) within the Plastic Litter Project 2021. Hyperspectral PRISMA, multispectral PlanetScope and visible Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) acquisitions were analysed. A nonlinear unmixing technique was applied to derive the spectral signature of the plastic target; finally, the linear unmixing approach allowed for determining the plastic percentage occupation at the pixel level. Different band combinations of the PRISMA data were selected to evaluate which provided the best result for the detection; one of these band combinations was retrieved via the principal component analysis. Only slight differences were achieved using the different PRISMA band-sets. As expected, since the artificial plastic target had a diameter comparable with the PRISMA spatial resolution (~30 m), its detection was a challenging task caused by the water influence in the pixel (mixed pixels). The detection was realized by benefitting from the high amount of available spectral bands, as confirmed by the comparative test with a PlanetScope image used at its original spatial resolution (3 m) and after degrading it at the PRISMA level. Results demonstrated that an optimal target detection was possible with few spectral bands, only taking advantage of the high spatial resolution (compared with the target dimension). Indeed, unreliable plastic fractions were derived at the PRISMA spatial resolution with a limited number of spectral bands. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Mountain ranges offer extraordinary opportunities to conduct research and monitor global change. Starting with a detailed analysis of the geographical setting, ecological dynamics and the history of human management, in this book, we focus on the uniqueness of the natural heritage of Sierra Nevada in both a historical and a global-change context. The 24 chapters of this book provide a full review of the diagnosis of the health status of Sierra Nevada ecosystems. All the evidence presented in this book reinforces our underlying idea of Sierra Nevada as a unique biophysical, historical and socio-economic laboratory and observatory of global change. This mountain is also of strategic importance as a provider of ecosystem services within the bounds of the National Park as well as for the surrounding region. This last chapter provides a critical review of what we have done so far, and what still needs to be done to improve research, monitoring, use of new technological tools (remote sensors, artificial intelligence, virtual research environments), user-oriented solutions and knowledge mobilization. The chapter ends with a final proposal: a mountain of all and for all, a joint journey of nature and people towards the mountain community. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - Traditionally, monitoring approaches to survey marine caves have been constrained by equipment limitations and strict safety protocols. Nowadays, the rise of new approaches opens new possibilities to describe these peculiar ecosystems. The current study aimed to explore the potential of Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of the sessile benthic assemblages inside a semi-submerged marine cave. Additionally, since impacts of recent date mussel Lithophaga lithophaga illegal fishing were recorded, a special emphasis was paid to its distribution and densities. The results of SfM were compared with a more “traditional approach”, by simulating photo-quadrats deployments over the produced orthomosaics. A total of 22 sessile taxa were identified, with Porifera representing the dominant taxa within the cave, and L. lithophaga presenting a density of 88.3 holes/m2. SfM and photo-quadrats obtained comparable results regarding species richness, percentage cover of identified taxa and most of the seascape metrics, while, in terms of taxa density estimations, photo-quadrats highly overestimated their values. SfM resulted in a suitable non-invasive technique to record marine cave assemblages. Seascape indexes proved to be a comprehensive way to describe the spatial pattern of distribution of benthic organisms, establishing a useful baseline to assess future community shifts. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity is critical for the coexistence of humans and the sustenance of other living organisms within the ecosystem. Identification and prioritization of specific regions to be conserved are impossible without proper information about the sites. Advanced monitoring agencies like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) had accredited that the sum total of species that are now threatened with extinction is higher than ever before in the past and are progressing toward extinct at an alarming rate. Besides this, the conceptualized global responses to these crises are still inadequate and entail drastic changes. Therefore, more sophisticated monitoring and conservation techniques are required which can simultaneously cover a larger surface area within a stipulated time frame and gather a large pool of data. Hence, this study is an overview of remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation via a survey of evidence-based reviews and related studies, wherein the description of the application of some technology for biodiversity conservation and monitoring is highlighted. Finally, the paper also describes various transformative smart technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning algorithms for enhanced working efficiency of currently available techniques that will aid remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Valued for its ecological richness and economic value, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is under substantial pressure from human activities. The Deepwater Horizon platform explosion and oil spill significantly damaged Gulf ecosystems and led to the largest ecological restoration investment in history. The unprecedented number and diversity of restoration activities provide valuable information for future restoration efforts, but assessment efforts are hampered by many factors, including the need to evaluate the interaction of multiple stressors and consider long-term environmental trends such as sea level rise, increasing hurricane intensity, and rising water temperatures. This report offers a comprehensive approach to assess restoration activities beyond the project scale in the face of a changing environment. A main component of this approach is using different types of scientific evidence to develop "multiple lines of evidence" to evaluate restoration efforts at regional scales and beyond, especially for projects that may be mutually reinforcing (synergistic) or in conflict (antagonistic). Because Gulf of Mexico ecosystems cross political boundaries, increased coordination and collaboration is needed, especially to develop standardized data collection, analysis, synthesis, and reporting. With these improvements, program-level adaptive management approaches can be used more effectively to assess restoration strategies against the backdrop of long-term environmental trends. © 2022 by the National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Changes in invasion understanding have been advocated for by researchers to better forecast invasions and lessen the consequences of invasive species on the environment and socioeconomics. This chapter aims to generate new ideas and promote research on remote sensing applications to advance robust invasion science and management. Remote sensing techniques can be used to examine and identify invasive species by combining a synergistic understanding of biological invasions associated with the aquaculture and shipping industries, invasive species detection aspects, limitations of marine remote sensing for invasion science, specific invasion metrics and change detection. Using these synergies is crucial for developing long-term management strategies based on interdisciplinary collaboration among academics, policymakers and communities. By monitoring and mapping the existence and distribution of marine invasive species, remote sensing can aid in ecosystem-based management of damaged coastal zones. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

AB  - This paper presents a semantic conceptual framework and definition of environmental monitoring and surveillance and demonstrates an ontology implementation of the framework. This framework is defined in a mathematical formulation and is built upon and focused on the notation of observation systems. This formulation is utilized in the analysis of the observation system. Three taxonomies are presented, namely, the taxonomy of (1) the sampling method, (2) the value format and (3) the functionality. The definition of concepts and their relationships in the conceptual framework clarifies the task of querying for information related to the state of the environment or conditions related to specific events. This framework aims to make the observation system more queryable and therefore more interactive for users or other systems. Using the proposed semantic conceptual framework, we derive definitions of the distinguished tasks of monitoring and surveillance. Monitoring is focused on the continuous assessment of an environment state and surveillance is focused on the collection of all data relevant for specific events. The proposed mathematical formulation is implemented in the format of the computer readable ontology. The presented ontology provides a general framework for the semantic retrieval of relevant environmental information. For the implementation of the proposed framework, we present a description of the Intelligent Forest Fire Video Monitoring and Surveillance system in Croatia. We present the implementation of the tasks of monitoring and surveillance in the application domain of forest fire management. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This article reports on Citizen Observatories’ (COs) potential to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reflecting on the experience of the GROW Observatory (GROW). The research aims to take the first steps in closing the gap in the literature on COs’ potential contributions to the SDG framework, beyond quantitative data contributions for indicator monitoring. Following an analysis of project activities and outcomes mapped against the SDG framework, the findings reveal GROW’s potential contributions across two dimensions: (i) Actions to advance the implementation of goals and targets through awareness raising and training; participatory methods; multi-stakeholder connections; and supporting citizens to move from data to action and (ii) Data contributions to SDG indicator monitoring through citizen-generated datasets. While earlier research has focused mostly on the latter (dimension ii), CO activities can impact numerous goals and targets, highlighting their potential to relate global SDGs to local level action, and vice versa. These findings align with the growing literature on COs’ ability to bring together policy makers, scientists and citizens, and support changes to environmental policy and practice. Furthermore, this research suggests groundwork activities that address the goal and target level can also enhance sustained data collection to contribute to indicator level monitoring. We conclude with future trends and recommendations for COs wishing to contribute to the SDGs. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - During the past decades, the composition and distribution of marine species have changed due to multiple anthropogenic pressures. Monitoring these changes in a cost-effective manner is of high relevance to assess the environmental status and evaluate the effectiveness of management measures. In particular, recent studies point to a rise of jellyfish populations on a global scale, negatively affecting diverse marine sectors like commercial fishing or the tourism industry. Past monitoring efforts using underwater video observations tended to be time-consuming and costly due to human-based data processing. In this paper, we present Jellytoring, a system to automatically detect and quantify different species of jellyfish based on a deep object detection neural network, allowing us to automatically record jellyfish presence during long periods of time. Jellytoring demonstrates outstanding performance on the jellyfish detection task, reaching an F1 score of 95.2%; and also on the jellyfish quantification task, as it correctly quantifies the number and class of jellyfish on a real-time processed video sequence up to a 93.8% of its duration. The results of this study are encouraging and provide the means towards a efficient way to monitor jellyfish, which can be used for the development of a jellyfish early-warning system, providing highly valuable information for marine biologists and contributing to the reduction of jellyfish impacts on humans. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - A knowledge of the characteristics of urban green spaces (UGSs) such as their abundance, spatial distribution and species composition, has an important role in a range of fields such as urban geography, urban planning and public health. Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Traditionally, the ocean economy is viewed solely as a mechanism for economic growth. In this business-as-usual approach, large-scale industrial economies have developed the ocean economy through the exploitation of maritime and marine resources, often without consideration of how those activities impact the future health or productivity of those same resources. This has led to aquatic ecosystems being viewed and treated as limitless resources; the marine environment becoming a dumping ground for waste; overfishing diminishing fishing stocks; ocean habitats being degraded from coastal developments; sea-level rise impacting coastal communities and infrastructure; increasing ocean acidification; and the marginalisation of poor coastal communities. Recognising the failings of the traditional ocean economy, there is a transition underway around the world towards the Blue Economy. This concept moves beyond the business-as-usual approach with economic development and ocean health complementary to one another. In the Blue Economy, the environmental risks of and ecological degradation from economic activity are mitigated or significantly reduced. Therefore, economic activity is in balance with the long-term capacity of the ocean ecosystems to support this activity and remain healthy and resilient. This book will provide an overview of the various technologies used to promote cross-sectoral and multi-scalar collaboration, facilitate the integrated management of sectors and resources, foster partnerships between governments and industry, encourage R&D in new technologies in resource use and management, and scale-up innovative financing mechanisms in the development of a Blue Economy. Also, the book will contain in-depth case studies that illustrate how locations, of differing climates, lifestyles and income levels, have implemented technologies to facilitate the development of the Blue Economy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature.

AB  - The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal Life Below Water (SDG-14) aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development”. Within SDG-14, targets 14.1 and 14.2 deal with marine pollution and the adverse impacts of human activities on aquatic systems. Here, we present a remote-sensing-based analysis of short-term changes in the Vembanad-Kol wetland system in the southwest of India. The region has experienced high levels of anthropogenic pressures, including from agriculture, industry, and tourism, leading to adverse ecological and socioeconomic impacts with consequences not only for achieving the targets set out in SDG-14, but also those related to water quality (SDG-6) and health (SDG-3). To move towards the sustainable management of coastal and aquatic ecosystems such as Lake Vembanad, it is important to understand how both natural and anthropogenic processes affect water quality. In 2020, a unique opportunity arose to study water quality in Lake Vembanad during a period when anthropogenic pressures were reduced due to a nationwide lockdown in response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (25 March–31 May 2020). Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multi-spectral remote sensing and in situ observations to analyse changes in five different water quality indicators, we show that water quality improved in large areas of Lake Vembanad during the lockdown in 2020, especially in the more central and southern regions, as evidenced by a decrease in total suspended matter, turbidity, and the absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter, all leading to clearer waters as indicated by the Forel-Ule classification of water colour. Further analysis of longer term trends (2013–2020) showed that water quality has been improving over time in the more northern regions of Lake Vembanad independent of the lockdown. The improvement in water quality during the lockdown in April–May 2020 illustrates the importance of addressing anthropogenic activities for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry can be used with digital underwater photographs to generate high-resolution bathymetry and orthomosaics with millimeter-to-centimeter scale resolution at relatively low cost. Although these products are useful for assessing species diversity and health, they have additional utility for quantifying benthic community structure, such as coral growth and fine-scale elevation change over time, if accurate length scales and georeferencing are included. This georeferencing is commonly provided with “ground control,” such as pre-installed seafloor benchmarks or identifiable “static” features, which can be difficult and time consuming to install, survey, and maintain. To address these challenges, we developed the SfM Quantitative Underwater Imaging Device with Five Cameras (SQUID-5), a towed surface vehicle with an onboard survey-grade Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and five rigidly mounted downward-looking cameras with overlapping views of the seafloor. The cameras are tightly synchronized with both the GNSS and each other to collect quintet photo sets and record the precise location of every collection event. The system was field tested in July 2019 in the U.S. Florida Keys, in water depths ranging from 3 to 9 m over a variety of bottom types. Surveying accuracy was assessed using pre-installed stations with known coordinates, machined scale bars, and two independent surveys of a site to evaluate repeatability. Under a range of sea conditions, ambient lighting, and water clarity, we were able to map living and senile coral reef habitats and sand waves at mm-scale resolution. Data were processed using best practice SfM techniques without ground control and local measurement errors of horizontal and vertical scales were consistently sub-millimeter, equivalent to 0.013% RMSE relative to water depth. Survey-to-survey repeatability RMSE was on the order of 3 cm without georeferencing but could be improved to several millimeters with the incorporation of one or more non-surveyed marker points. We demonstrate that the SQUID-5 platform can map complex coral reef and other seafloor habitats and measure mm-to-cm scale changes in the morphology and location of seafloor features over time without pre-existing ground control. © Copyright © 2020 Hatcher, Warrick, Ritchie, Dailey, Zawada, Kranenburg and Yates.

AB  - The rivers of the world are undergoing accelerated change in the Anthropocene, and need to be managed at much broader spatial and temporal scales than before. Fluvial remote sensing now offers a technical and methodological framework that can be deployed to monitor the processes at work and to assess the trajectories of rivers in the Anthropocene. In this paper, we review research investigating past, present and future fluvial corridor conditions and processes using remote sensing and we consider emerging challenges facing fluvial and riparian research. We introduce a suite of remote sensing methods designed to diagnose river changes at reach to regional scales. We then focus on identification of channel patterns and acting processes from satellite, airborne or ground acquisitions. These techniques range from grain scales to landform scales, and from real time scales to inter-annual scales. We discuss how remote sensing data can now be coupled to catchment scale models that simulate sediment transfer within connected river networks. We also consider future opportunities in terms of datasets and other resources which are likely to impact river management and monitoring at the global scale. We conclude with a summary of challenges and prospects for remotely sensed rivers in the Anthropocene. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Around the world, cities provide plenty of opportunities such as better education, advanced health treatment facilities, better employment, commerce and trade as compared to rural areas. Therefore, more than half the world’s people live and work together in urban communities and it is projected that by the year 2030, three out of five people will stay in cities. The unrestrained and rapid growth of cities has also brought environmental degradation and causes many serious problems such as worsening of air quality, loss of natural habitat and species diversity, and increased human health risks associated with heat waves, noise and crowding. In most urban areas of developing countries, a variety of harmful air pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are emitted from a variety of sources, mainly the burning of wood, fossil fuels and vehicular emissions, which adversely affects the health of human beings, animals and other living creatures. In the urban environment, trees provide many economic, social and environmental benefits to people, such as aesthetic beauty, improvement of property values, erosion prevention, storm water management, noise reduction, mental health development and crime reduction. In addition, trees help cool the air by shading surfaces that otherwise would absorb the sun’s energy and then reradiate it out as heat. Trees also cool the ambient air. Urban trees on average reduce air temperatures on summer days by 2-4˚F, although in some circumstances the cooling effect can be even larger. Trees also sequester carbon, helping to mitigate climate change. The efficiency of atmospheric cleansing by trees in congested cities could be improved by planting more trees other than shrubs or herbs. Generally, avenue trees act as living filters to decrease pollution through absorption, accumulation and detoxification. Trees remove gaseous air pollutants such as ozone, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide mainly by uptake via leaf stomata, although some gases are removed by the plant surface. Once inside the leaf, gaseous air pollutants diffuse into intercellular spaces and may be absorbed by water films to form acids or react with inner leaf surfaces. Though some particles can be absorbed into the tree, most particles settle on the branches, leaves and twigs of plants and are washed out by the rain. Throughout the world, different advanced technologies such as smog-free towers in the Netherlands and adhesive roads for particulate matter in London have been applied. However, these technologies are extremely costly and unaffordable for countries like India and therefore the most eco-friendly and cost-effective way is plantation of tolerant tree species alongside highways, city streets, in parks, and in residential yards. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The problem: Earth-based observations of the biosphere are spatially biased in ways that can limit our ability to detect macroecological patterns and changes in biodiversity. To resolve this problem, we need to supplement the ad hoc data currently collected with planned biodiversity monitoring, in order to approximate global stratified random sampling of the planet. We call this all-encompassing observational system ‘the macroscope’. The solution: With a focus on the marine realm, we identify seven main biosphere observation tools that compose the macroscope: satellites, drones, camera traps, passive acoustic samplers, biologgers, environmental DNA and human observations. By deploying a nested array of these tools that fills current gaps in monitoring, we can achieve a macroscope fit for purpose and turn these existing powerful tools into more than the sum of their parts. An appeal: Building a macroscope requires commitment from many fields, together with coordinated actions to attract the level of funding required for such a venture. We call on macroecologists to become advocates for the macroscope and to engage with existing global observation networks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Merging together the fields of urban ecology, environmental justice, and urban environmental education, Urban Ecosystem Justice promotes building fair, accessible, and mutually beneficial relationships between citizens and the soils, water, atmospheres, and biodiversity in their cities. This book provides a framework for recentering issues of justice and fairness in sustainability discourse while challenging the profound ecological alienation experienced by urban residents. While the urban sustainability movement has had many successes in the past few decades, there remain areas for it to grow. For one, the benefits of sustainability have disproportionately benefited wealthier city residents, with concerns over equity, justice, and social sustainability frequently taking a back seat to economic and environmental considerations. Additionally, many city dwellers remain estranged from and unfamiliar with ecological processes, with urban environments often thought of as existing outside of nature or as hopelessly degraded. Through a citizen-centered lens, the book offers a guide to reconciling these issues by demonstrating how questions of equity, access, and justice apply to the biophysical dimensions of the urban ecosystem: Soil, water, air, waste, and biodiversity. Drawing heavily from the fields of urban ecology, environmental justice, and ecological design, this book lays out a science of cities for people: A pedagogical platform that can be used to promote ecological literacy in underrepresented urban communities through affordable and decentralized means. This book provides both a theoretical and practical field guide to students and researchers of urban sustainability, city planners, architects, policymakers, and activists wishing to develop reciprocal relationships with urban ecologies. © 2022 Scott Kellogg.

AB  - Maintaining healthy, productive ecosystems in the face of pervasive and accelerating human impacts including climate change requires globally coordinated and sustained observations of marine biodiversity. Global coordination is predicated on an understanding of the scope and capacity of existing monitoring programs, and the extent to which they use standardized, interoperable practices for data management. Global coordination also requires identification of gaps in spatial and ecosystem coverage, and how these gaps correspond to management priorities and information needs. We undertook such an assessment by conducting an audit and gap analysis from global databases and structured surveys of experts. Of 371 survey respondents, 203 active, long-term (>5 years) observing programs systematically sampled marine life. These programs spanned about 7% of the ocean surface area, mostly concentrated in coastal regions of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Seagrasses, mangroves, hard corals, and macroalgae were sampled in 6% of the entire global coastal zone. Two-thirds of all observing programs offered accessible data, but methods and conditions for access were highly variable. Our assessment indicates that the global observing system is largely uncoordinated which results in a failure to deliver critical information required for informed decision-making such as, status and trends, for the conservation and sustainability of marine ecosystems and provision of ecosystem services. Based on our study, we suggest four key steps that can increase the sustainability, connectivity and spatial coverage of biological Essential Ocean Variables in the global ocean: (1) sustaining existing observing programs and encouraging coordination among these; (2) continuing to strive for data strategies that follow FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable); (3) utilizing existing ocean observing platforms and enhancing support to expand observing along coasts of developing countries, in deep ocean basins, and near the poles; and (4) targeting capacity building efforts. Following these suggestions could help create a coordinated marine biodiversity observing system enabling ecological forecasting and better planning for a sustainable use of ocean resources.

AB  - Coral reefs are an essential source of marine biodiversity, but they are declining at an alarming rate under the combined effects of global change and human pressure. A precise mapping of coral reef habitat with high spatial and time resolutions has become a necessary step for monitoring their health and evolution. This mapping can be achieved remotely thanks to satellite imagery coupled with machine-learning algorithms. In this paper, we review the different satellites used in recent literature, as well as the most common and efficient machine-learning methods. To account for the recent explosion of published research on coral reel mapping, we especially focus on the papers published between 2018 and 2020. Our review study indicates that object-based methods provide more accurate results than pixel-based ones, and that the most accurate methods are Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. We emphasize that the satellites with the highest spatial resolution provide the best images for benthic habitat mapping. We also highlight that preprocessing steps (water column correction, sunglint removal, etc.) and additional inputs (bathymetry data, aerial photographs, etc.) can significantly improve the mapping accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper offers a summary of different crowdsourcing modes to collect geo-information on landscape perception & preferences and cultural ecosystem services. Crowdsourcing modes range from harvesting information passively transmitted by large groups on the web to actively engaging the crowd to generate data by using dedicated mobile apps and web-platforms. The latter, active crowdsourcing projects, were described in more detail by analysing the organizational variables of the twelve projects that were identified. Crowdsourcing has great potential to advance the field of landscape perception & preference research as it enables the in-situ collection of real-time, location-based data. One of the main limitations of reviewed active and passive crowdsourcing modes, lies in the fact that sample selection bias easily occurs and sample representativeness of any target population has been proven hard to achieve. Often crowdsourcing projects are implemented with a strong focus on technical aspects and content, but with insufficient attention for participant engagement. Projects would benefit from more inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and professionalizing campaigns, and thereby bringing participant engagement to the heart of the project. We recommend more attention to be placed towards awareness raising, diversification of formats and activities to reach a larger diversity of participants, structured tracking of performance indicators and learning from participants’ feedback. Such strategies aim at enhancing participation and reducing bias in participant selection, which constrains the usefulness of the results for research, planning and policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vegetation phenology is the study of recurring plant life cycle stages, seasonality which is linked to many ecosystem processes and is an important proxy of climate and environmental change. Remote sensing has been playing an important and increasing role in the monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology. The aim of this review is to critically examine key studies related to remote sensing of vegetation phenology, with a special focus on temperate and boreal forests. Specifically, we focus on how the latest ground, near-surface and aerial data have been used to assess the satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the agreements that has been achieved in the last 15 years. Results demonstrated that the timing of satellite-derived LSP events can be detected, in the best-case scenarios, with a certainty of around half-week for spring metrics (e.g. Day of Year -DOY- of start of growing season) and around one week for autumn metrics (e.g. DOY of end of growing season). With expected shifts in plant phenology averaging <1 day per decade, such LSP uncertainties (in terms of absolute phenological dates) could greatly over- or under-estimate these species-level shifts; but the spatial variation in phenology can be consistently monitored. An increasing number of studies have investigated autumn phenology in the last decade, but autumn phenological dates continue to be more challenging to retrieve and interpret than spring dates. Emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of forest phenology is presented that includes synergetic use of multiple orbital sensors and its LSP evaluation with data from new sensors at a ground, near-surface and airborne level; yet traditional ground-based observations will continue to be highly useful to accurately record the timing of species-specific phenological events. This review might provide a guide for planning and managing remote sensing of forest phenology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landscape ecology studies are often conducted over large scale extents. Consequently, the use of remotely sensed data is the norm in landscape studies, and there is a strong association between remote sensing and landscape ecology. This chapter examines the constant improvements in remote sensing technologies and their application to landscape ecology, from sensors onboard planes and satellites to ground-based devices and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). After existing sensors and approaches, current and future opportunities are surveyed. Current tools for mapping vegetation and ecosystem, investigating spatial structure, examining landscape processes, and understanding anthropogenic drivers of landscape change are based on combinations of passive (e.g., hyperspectral) and active (e.g., LiDAR) sensors. Future opportunities will come from new sensors on board new satellites, combined with citizen science for ground truthing and cloud computing for analyzing ever larger volumes of remotely sensed data. As sensors become diverse and the platforms on which they sit more versatile, opportunities from remote sensing to broaden the scope of landscape ecology and its research questions will only continue to grow. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Robert A.

AB  - Large-area remote sensing time-series offer unique features for the extensive investigation of our environment. Since various error sources in the acquisition chain of datasets exist, only properly validated results can be of value for research and downstream decision processes. This review presents an overview of validation approaches concerning temporally dense time-series of land surface geo-information products that cover the continental to global scale. Categorization according to utilized validation data revealed that product intercomparisons and comparison to reference data are the conventional validation methods. The reviewed studies are mainly based on optical sensors and orientated towards global coverage, with vegetation-related variables as the focus. Trends indicate an increase in remote sensing-based studies that feature long-term datasets of land surface variables. The hereby corresponding validation efforts show only minor methodological diversification in the past two decades. To sustain comprehensive and standardized validation efforts, the provision of spatiotemporally dense validation data in order to estimate actual differences between measurement and the true state has to be maintained. The promotion of novel approaches can, on the other hand, prove beneficial for various downstream applications, although typically only theoretical uncertainties are provided. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes, also referred to as Eichhornia crassipes) is one of the most invasive weed species in the world, causing significant adverse economic and ecological impacts, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Large scale real-time monitoring of areas of chronic infestation is critical to formulate effective control strategies for this fast spreading weed species. Assessment of revenue generation potential of the harvested water hyacinth biomass also requires enhanced understanding to estimate the biomass yield potential for a given water body. Modern remote sensing technologies can greatly enhance our capacity to understand, monitor, and estimate water hyacinth infestation within inland as well as coastal freshwater bodies. Readily available satellite imagery with high spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution, along with conventional and modern machine learning techniques for automated image analysis, can enable discrimination of water hyacinth infestation from other floating or submerged vegetation. Remote sensing can potentially be complemented with an array of other technology-based methods, including aerial surveys, ground-level sensors, and citizen science, to provide comprehensive, timely, and accurate monitoring. This review discusses the latest developments in the use of remote sensing and other technologies to monitor water hyacinth infestation, and proposes a novel, multi-modal approach that combines the strengths of the different methods. © Copyright © 2021 Datta, Maharaj, Prabhu, Bhowmik, Marino, Akbari, Rupavatharam, Sujeetha, Anantrao, Poduvattil, Kumar and Kleczkowski.

AB  - The spread of invasive alien species promotes ecosystem structure and functioning changes, with detrimental effects on native biodiversity and ecosystem services, raising challenges for local management authorities. Predictions of invasion dynamics derived from modeling tools are often spatially coarse and therefore unsuitable for guiding local management. Accurate information on the occurrence of invasive plants and on the main factors that promote their spread is critical to define successful control strategies. For addressing this challenge, we developed a dual framework combining satellite image classification with predictive ecological modeling. By combining data from georeferenced invaded areas with multispectral imagery with 10-meter resolution from Sentinel-2 satellites, a map of areas invaded by the woody invasive Acacia longifolia in a municipality of northern Portugal was devised. Classifier fusion techniques were implemented through which eight statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to produce accurate maps of invaded areas. Through a Random Forest (RF) model, these maps were then used to explore the factors driving the landscape-level abundance of A. longifolia. RF models were based on explanatory variables describing hypothesized environmental drivers, including climate, topography/geomorphology, soil properties, fire disturbance, landscape composition, linear structures, and landscape spatial configuration. Satellite-based maps synoptically described the spatial patterns of invaded areas, with classifications attaining high accuracy values (True Skill Statistic, TSS: 0.895, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, ROC: 0.988, Kappa: 0.857). The predictive RF models highlighted the primary role of climate, followed by landscape composition and configuration, as the most important drivers explaining the species abundance at the landscape level. Our innovative dual framework—combining image classification and predictive ecological modeling—can guide decision-making processes regarding effective management of invasions by prioritizing the invaded areas and tackling the primary environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the species’ abundance and spread. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Marine mammals can play important ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems, and their presence can be key to community structure and function. Consequently, marine mammals are often considered indicators of ecosystem health and flagship species. Yet, historical population declines caused by exploitation, and additional current threats, such as climate change, fisheries bycatch, pollution and maritime development, continue to impact many marine mammal species, and at least 25% are classified as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) on the IUCN Red List. Conversely, some species have experienced population increases/recoveries in recent decades, reflecting management interventions, and are heralded as conservation successes. To continue these successes and reverse the downward trajectories of at-risk species, it is necessary to evaluate the threats faced by marine mammals and the conservation mechanisms available to address them. Additionally, there is a need to identify evidence-based priorities of both research and conservation needs across a range of settings and taxa. To that effect we: (1) outline the key threats to marine mammals and their impacts, identify the associated knowledge gaps and recommend actions needed; (2) discuss the merits and downfalls of established and emerging conservation mechanisms; (3) outline the application of research and monitoring techniques; and (4) highlight particular taxa/populations that are in urgent need of focus. © The authors 2021.

AB  - The Northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP), located in West Antarctica, is amongst the most impacted regions by recent warming events. Its vulnerability to climate change has already led to an accumulation of severe changes along its ecosystems. This work reviews the current findings on impacts observed in phytoplankton communities occurring in the NAP, with a focus on its causes, consequences, and the potential research priorities toward an integrated comprehension of the physical–biological coupling and climate perspective. Evident changes in phytoplankton biomass, community composition and size structure, as well as potential bottom-up impacts to the ecosystem are discussed. Surface wind, sea ice and meltwater dynamics, as key drivers of the upper layer structure, are identified as the leading factors shaping phytoplankton. Short- and long-term scenarios are suggested for phytoplankton communities in the NAP, both indicating a future increase of the importance of small flagellates at the expense of diatoms, with potential devastating impacts for the ecosystem. Five main research gaps in the current understanding of the phytoplankton response to climate change in the region are identified: (i) anthropogenic signal has yet to be disentangled from natural climate variability; (ii) the influence of small-scale ocean circulation processes on phytoplankton is poorly understood; (iii) the potential consequences to regional food webs must be clarified; (iv) the magnitude and risk of potential changes in phytoplankton composition is relatively unknown; and (v) a better understanding of phytoplankton physiological responses to changes in the environmental conditions is required. Future research directions, along with specific suggestions on how to follow them, are equally suggested. Overall, while the current knowledge has shed light on the response of phytoplankton to climate change, in order to truly comprehend and predict changes in phytoplankton communities, there must be a robust collaboration effort integrating both Antarctic research programs and the whole scientific community under a common research framework. © Copyright © 2020 Ferreira, Costa, Dotto, Kerr, Tavano, Brito, Brotas, Secchi and Mendes.

AB  - The spatial patterns of species richness can be used as indicators for conservation and restoration, but data problems, including the lack of species surveys and geographical data gaps, are obstacles to mapping species richness across large areas. Lack of species data can be overcome with remote sensing because it covers extended geographic areas and generates recurring data. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) framework using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and modeled potential species richness by stacking species distribution models (S-SDMs) to ask, “What are the spatial patterns of potential plant species richness across the Korean Peninsula, including inaccessible North Korea, where survey data are limited?” First, we estimated plant species richness in South Korea by combining the probability-based SDM results of 1574 species and used independent plant surveys to validate our potential species richness maps. Next, DL-based species richness models were fitted to the species richness results in South Korea, and a time-series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS. The individually developed models from South Korea were statistically tested using datasets that were not used in model training and obtained high accuracy outcomes (0.98, Pearson correlation). Finally, the proposed models were combined to estimate the richness patterns across the Korean Peninsula at a higher spatial resolution than the species survey data. From the statistical feature importance tests overall, growing season NDVI-related features were more important than LAI features for quantifying biodiversity from remote sensing time-series data. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The unprecedented size of the human population, along with its associated economic activities, has an ever-increasing impact on global environments. Across the world, countries are concerned about the growing resource consumption and the capacity of ecosystems to provide resources. To effectively conserve biodiversity, it is essential to make indicators and knowledge openly available to decision-makers in ways that they can effectively use them. The development and deployment of tools and techniques to generate these indicators require having access to trustworthy data from biological collections, field surveys and automated sensors, molecular data, and historic academic literature. The transformation of these raw data into synthesized information that is fit for use requires going through many refinement steps. The methodologies and techniques applied to manage and analyze these data constitute an area usually called biodiversity informatics. Biodiversity data follow a life cycle consisting of planning, collection, certification, description, preservation, discovery, integration, and analysis. Researchers, whether producers or consumers of biodiversity data, will likely perform activities related to at least one of these steps. This article explores each stage of the life cycle of biodiversity data, discussing its methodologies, tools, and challenges.

AB  - Repeat digital photography at or near ground-level is a proven and efficient approach for tracking plant phenology. Here, we explored the potential to monitor phenology using the Snapshot Wisconsin (SW) trail camera network, a citizen science program. Using three curve-fitting methods for characterizing phenological transition dates, we assessed the phenological offset between understory vegetation and the overstory canopy in the trailcam observations and compared variations in derived phenology over the different spatial scales represented by trailcams (~20–50 m), Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS, 30 m), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 500 m). Our results showed that the apparent phenological offset between understory and overstory vegetation differed among forest types: in broadleaf deciduous forests, understory vegetation had an earlier start-of-spring (SOS) and later end-of-autumn (EOA) than the overstory canopy; in mixed forests, the understory showed an earlier SOS than the overstory, but no significant difference in EOA; in evergreen conifer forests, neither SOS nor EOA differed significantly between the understory and overstory. We found moderate correlations (0.25 ≤ r ≤ 0.57) between trailcam- and satellite-derived phenological dates. Moreover, those derived dates varied significantly among the applied curve-fitting methods: total growing season length (from SOS to EOA) could be 19 days longer for a threshold-based method than for a logistic curve-fitting method (our reference model), but 17 days shorter than the logistic method when using a piecewise-continuous method based on fitted sine curves. Despite the spatial limitations of trailcams for characterizing phenology on landscape and regional scales, trailcam networks have considerable potential for informing local phenological studies and disentangling the many drivers of phenology that can remain undetected from the satellite perspective. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Remote sensing, or Earth Observation (EO), is increasingly used to understand Earth system dynamics and create continuous and categorical maps of biophysical properties and land cover, especially based on recent advances in machine learning (ML). ML models typically require large, spatially explicit training datasets to make accurate predictions. Training data (TD) are typically generated by digitizing polygons on high spatial-resolution imagery, by collecting in situ data, or by using pre-existing datasets. TD are often assumed to accurately represent the truth, but in practice almost always have error, stemming from (1) sample design, and (2) sample collection errors. The latter is particularly relevant for image-interpreted TD, an increasingly commonly used method due to its practicality and the increasing training sample size requirements of modern ML algorithms. TD errors can cause substantial errors in the maps created using ML algorithms, which may impact map use and interpretation. Despite these potential errors and their real-world consequences for map-based decisions, TD error is often not accounted for or reported in EO research. Here we review the current practices for collecting and handling TD. We identify the sources of TD error, and illustrate their impacts using several case studies representing different EO applications (infrastructure mapping, global surface flux estimates, and agricultural monitoring), and provide guidelines for minimizing and accounting for TD errors. To harmonize terminology, we distinguish TD from three other classes of data that should be used to create and assess ML models: training reference data, used to assess the quality of TD during data generation; validation data, used to iteratively improve models; and map reference data, used only for final accuracy assessment. We focus primarily on TD, but our advice is generally applicable to all four classes, and we ground our review in established best practices for map accuracy assessment literature. EO researchers should start by determining the tolerable levels of map error and appropriate error metrics. Next, TD error should be minimized during sample design by choosing a representative spatio-temporal collection strategy, by using spatially and temporally relevant imagery and ancillary data sources during TD creation, and by selecting a set of legend definitions supported by the data. Furthermore, TD error can be minimized during the collection of individual samples by using consensus-based collection strategies, by directly comparing interpreted training observations against expert-generated training reference data to derive TD error metrics, and by providing image interpreters with thorough application-specific training. We strongly advise that TD error is incorporated in model outputs, either directly in bias and variance estimates or, at a minimum, by documenting the sources and implications of error. TD should be fully documented and made available via an open TD repository, allowing others to replicate and assess its use. To guide researchers in this process, we propose three tiers of TD error accounting standards. Finally, we advise researchers to clearly communicate the magnitude and impacts of TD error on map outputs, with specific consideration given to the likely map audience. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background & Aims: The species diversity of canopy trees is important for the function and service of natural forest ecosystems. To be able to formulate reasonable biodiversity conservation strategies, it is important to understand patterns of forest canopy diversity through time. However, the development of high-precision forest canopy diversity monitoring at a regional scale is slow due to a limitation in diversity information collection methods. A lot of biodiversity patterns may substantially change due to climate change and human disturbance. However, updating these changes in biodiversity cannot be done in a timely manner. In recent years, the development of canopy hyperspectral image collection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and analysis technology has provided an opportunity for the development of new tools for canopy diversity monitoring. Progresses: Here, we propose using the hyperspectral image of forest canopy for biodiversity monitoring and conservation, development of UAV aerial photography and spatial positioning technology, and the development of hyperspectral image processing technology with deep learning. We use the existing literature to discuss the research status, feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of using UAV hyperspectral imaging for monitoring of species diversity of forest canopy trees. We believe that canopy hyperspectral images provide indispensable and abundant information for forest biodiversity monitoring. The combination of UAVs and hyperspectral cameras makes it possible to automate the collection of canopy diversity information with both high frequency (e.g., weekly) and high precision (e.g., decimeter- or centimeter-level) at the regional scale. At the same time, the leap in image processing technology made possible through deep learning enables the extraction of individual and species information from canopy hyperspectral images with extremely high precision. Prospects: Hyperspectral images have rich spectral and spatial information, which greatly improves the identification accuracy of plant species. The combination of UAVs and hyperspectral cameras greatly reduces the difficulty and cost for acquisition of this data. Applying deep learning methods to hyperspectral image processing can effectively collect species diversity information contained in hyperspectral images, and accelerate the research on forest canopy diversity monitoring on a large-scale. However, due to an insufficient sample size of hyperspectral data for species and a limitation in common deep learning models not being fully optimized for hyperspectral images remains a challenge. Future challenges for research include: how to build the hyperspectral species database, how to combine the characteristics of hyperspectral data, and how to optimize the automatic species recognition algorithm. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The role of water quality, particularly its impact on health, environment and wider well-being, are rarely acknowledged in the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus. Here we demonstrate the necessity to include water quality within the water dimension of the WEF nexus to address complex and multi-disciplinary challenges facing humanity. Firstly, we demonstrate the impact of water quality on the energy and food dimensions of the WEF nexus and vice versa at multiple scales, from households to cities, regions and transboundary basins. Secondly, we use examples to demonstrate how including water quality would have augmented and improved the WEF analysis and its application. Finally, we encourage hydrological scientists to promote relevant water quality research as addressing WEF nexus challenges. To make tangible progress, we propose that analysis of water quality interactions focuses initially on WEF nexus “hotspots,” such as cities, semi-arid areas, and areas dependent on groundwater or climate change-threatened meltwater. © 2021 IAHS.

AB  - Camera traps are a widely used tool in wildlife research and conservation, but in situ factors such as theft, poor performance in extreme environments and damage by wildlife may be hindering the effectiveness of the technology. However, we still know little about how widespread these constraints are and which are the priorities to solve in the short- and mid-term. We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66%, 50% and 42% of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trapping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera-trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near-future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data. Ultimately, this will increase the capacity of researchers and conservationists to implement coordinated wildlife monitoring at unprecedented scales. © 2019 The Authors Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London.

AB  - Digital technologies, including participatory Internet mapping, social media and smartphones, provide new avenues for research in outdoor recreation and tourism. The potential to reach a greater audience and collect visitation data on a broader scale, with less costs than traditional paper surveys, are key advantages that have increased the use of these novel technologies. Using of mobile apps for data collection is still at the experimental stage. We evaluate previous attempts to use apps for monitoring recreation and tourism in protected areas, as an alternative to other in situ or online methods. We present a pilot study implemented in Jotunheimen National Park (Norway), where we developed a mobile app for visitor monitoring and real-time mapping of values and experiences. We present the lessons learned, give suggestions on how and for what apps can be used, and discuss the advantages and limitations of using smartphones for visitor monitoring in protected areas. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Data are essential in all areas of geophysics. They are used to better understand and manage systems, either directly or via models. Given the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of geophysical systems (e.g., precipitation), a lack of sufficient data is a perennial problem, which is exacerbated by various drivers, such as climate change and urbanization. In recent years, crowdsourcing has become increasingly prominent as a means of supplementing data obtained from more traditional sources, particularly due to its relatively low implementation cost and ability to increase the spatial and/or temporal resolution of data significantly. Given the proliferation of different crowdsourcing methods in geophysics and the promise they have shown, it is timely to assess the state of the art in this field, to identify potential issues and map out a way forward. In this paper, crowdsourcing-based data acquisition methods that have been used in seven domains of geophysics, including weather, precipitation, air pollution, geography, ecology, surface water, and natural hazard management, are discussed based on a review of 162 papers. In addition, a novel framework for categorizing these methods is introduced and applied to the methods used in the seven domains of geophysics considered in this review. This paper also features a review of 93 papers dealing with issues that are common to data acquisition methods in different domains of geophysics, including the management of crowdsourcing projects, data quality, data processing, and data privacy. In each of these areas, the current status is discussed and challenges and future directions are outlined. ©2018. The Authors.

AB  - In the American West, wildfires and earthquakes are increasingly threatening the archaeological, historical, and tribal resources that define the collective identity and connection with the past for millions of Americans. The loss of said resources diminishes societal understanding of the role cultural heritage plays in shaping our present and future. This paper examines the viability of employing stationary and SLAM-based terrestrial laser scanning, close-range photogrammetry, automated surface change detection, GIS, and WebGL visualization techniques to enhance the preservation of cultural resources in California. Our datafication approach combines multi-temporal remote sensing monitoring of historic features with legacy data and collaborative visualization to document and evaluate how environmental threats affect built heritage. We tested our methodology in response to recent environmental threats from wildfire and earthquakes at Bodie, an iconic Gold Rush-era boom town located on the California and Nevada border. Our multi-scale results show that the proposed approach effectively integrates highly accurate 3D snapshots of Bodie’s historic buildings before/after disturbance, or post-restoration, with surface change detection and online collaborative visualization of 3D geospatial data to monitor and preserve important cultural resources at the site. This study concludes that the proposed workflow enhances the monitoring of at-risk California’s cultural heritage and makes a call to action to employ remote sensing as a pathway to advanced planning. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Policy makers need access to reliable data to monitor and evaluate the progress of development outcomes and targets such as sustainable development outcomes (SDGs). However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data—that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected—offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways.The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs. Objectives: Identify and appraise rigorous impact evaluations (IEs), systematic reviews and the studies that have innovatively used big data to measure any development outcomes with special reference to difficult contexts. Search Methods: A number of general and specialised data bases and reporsitories of organisations were searched using keywords related to big data by an information specialist. Selection Criteria: The studies were selected on basis of whether they used big data sources to measure or evaluate development outcomes. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection was conducted using a data extraction tool and all extracted data was entered into excel and then analysed using Stata. The data analysis involved looking at trends and descriptive statistics only. Main Results: The search yielded over 17,000 records, which we then screened down to 437 studies which became the foundation of our systematic map. We found that overall, there is a sizable and rapidly growing number of measurement studies using big data but a much smaller number of IEs. We also see that the bulk of the big data sources are machine-generated (mostly satellites) represented in the light blue. We find that satellite data was used in over 70% of the measurement studies and in over 80% of the IEs. Authors' Conclusions: This map gives us a sense that there is a lot of work being done to develop appropriate measures using big data which could subsequently be used in IEs. Information on costs, ethics, transparency is lacking in the studies and more work is needed in this area to understand the efficacies related to the use of big data. There are a number of outcomes which are not being studied using big data, either due to the lack to applicability such as education or due to lack of awareness about the new methods and data sources. The map points to a number of gaps as well as opportunities where future researchers can conduct research. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been extensively explored from global archives of satellite observations to track and monitor the seasonality of rangeland ecosystems in response to climate change. Long term monitoring of LSP provides large potential for the evaluation of interactions and feedbacks between climate and vegetation. With a special focus on the rangeland ecosystems, the paper reviews the progress, challenges and emerging opportunities in LSP while identifying possible gaps that could be explored in future. Specifically, the paper traces the evolution of satellite sensors and interrogates their properties as well as the associated indices and algorithms in estimating and monitoring LSP in productive rangelands. Findings from the literature revealed that the spectral characteristics of the early satellite sensors such as Landsat, AVHRR and MODIS played a critical role in the development of spectral vegetation indices that have been widely used in LSP applications. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pioneered LSP investigations, and most other spectral vegetation indices were primarily developed to address the weaknesses and shortcomings of the NDVI. New indices continue to be developed based on recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 that are characterized by unique spectral signatures and fine spatial resolutions, and their successful usage is catalyzed with the development of cutting-edge algorithms for modeling the LSP profiles. In this regard, the paper has documented several LSP algorithms that are designed to provide data smoothing, gap filling and LSP metrics retrieval methods in a single environment. In the future, the development of machine learning algorithms that can effectively model and characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation would help to unlock the value of LSP information in the rangeland monitoring and management process. Precisely, deep learning presents an opportunity to further develop robust software packages such as the decomposition and analysis of time series (DATimeS) with the abundance of data processing tools and techniques that can be used to better characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation in rangeland ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Protected areas (PA) cover an impressive 62% of Laos’ land surface, however there are a lot of low biodiversity value residential and agricultural areas within the protected area network (PAN). The Government of Laos is aiming to re-delineate the PAN in order to exclude these areas. We support this aim by estimating how efficiently different protected area categories have reduced deforestation, by modeling priority areas for conservation and by evaluating the mismatch between these and the current PAN. Protection effectiveness was analyzed via combined matching and regression method, which indicates that only National Protected Areas have actually reduced deforestation, while the remaining PA categories have had negligible impacts. Spatial multi-criteria decision analysis supported by local and international expert knowledge on conservation, forestry and land management was used to model conservation priority areas, which were compared with the current PAN. The results indicate that vast overprotected low conservation priority areas exist inside the PAN, especially within Protection Forest Areas. Based on these findings, we argue that the current PAN is ineffective and inappropriately targeted. We recommend that Laos re-delineates and downsizes its PAN to ensure sufficient management of remaining high conservation priority areas both inside and outside the PAN. We further discuss potential methods and co-benefits of PA re-delineation in Laos’ context. The findings are also globally linked to limitations of systematic conservation planning in data-scarce developing countries and the need to improve both quality and coverage of biodiversity data alongside protected area monitoring and management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The abundance of marine debris was quantified for a total of sixty-two inaccessible beaches in the western Saronikos Gulf, Greece. High resolution images were obtained through vessel-based photography survey, merged into seamless photomosaics, and manually processed to quantify beach litter abundance. A sample of four selected beaches were subjected to detailed photography followed by beach macro-litter (≥ 2.5 cm) in-situ sampling surveys over a period of one year, to calibrate and validate the proposed method. Regression analysis between photographic and in-situ data showed a significant correlation, hence providing a highly accurate regression model to assess the real number of beach litter stranded on the rest of the investigated beaches, exhibiting clear correlations to the hydrodynamic status of the area and, provide an indication of the main litter sources. The proposed method is an easily applicable and useful tool for fast and low-cost macro-litter monitoring in extended, remote coastlines, when only photographic data are available. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many ecologists have lamented the demise of natural history and have attributed this decline to a misguided view that natural history is outdated and unscientific. Although there is a perception that the focus in ecology and conservation have shifted away from descriptive natural history research and training toward hypothetico-deductive research, we argue that natural history has entered a new phase that we call “next-generation natural history.” This renaissance of natural history is characterized by technological and statistical advances that aid in collecting detailed observations systematically over broad spatial and temporal extents. The technological advances that have increased exponentially in the last decade include electronic sensors such as camera-traps and acoustic recorders, aircraft- and satellite-based remote sensing, animal-borne biologgers, genetics and genomics methods, and community science programs. Advances in statistics and computation have aided in analyzing a growing quantity of observations to reveal patterns in nature. These robust next-generation natural history datasets have transformed the anecdotal perception of natural history observations into systematically collected observations that collectively constitute the foundation for hypothetico-deductive research and can be leveraged and applied to conservation and management. These advances are encouraging scientists to conduct and embrace detailed descriptions of nature that remain a critically important component of the scientific endeavor. Finally, these next-generation natural history observations are engaging scientists and non-scientists alike with new documentations of the wonders of nature. Thus, we celebrate next-generation natural history for encouraging people to experience nature directly. © Copyright © 2021 Tosa, Dziedzic, Appel, Urbina, Massey, Ruprecht, Eriksson, Dolliver, Lesmeister, Betts, Peres and Levi.

AB  - Biodiversity is essential to healthy ecosystem function, influencing productivity and resilience to disturbance. Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity – biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Knowledge of flowering phenology is essential for understanding the condition of forest ecosystems and responses to various anthropogenic and environmental drivers. However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Drone-derived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE <4% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Visual methods based on remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used to study and monitor mesophotic-to-deep benthic marine ecosystems. To date, these techniques are frequently used to meet the requirements for benthic habitat mapping of most national and international directives and marine ecosystem management programs (e.g., Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and OSPAR Convention), by supporting the exploration of taxonomical composition of biological communities, the identification of ecologically relevant habitat, and the identification of areas of priority for conservation. However, the processing of visual data is challenging in terms of analytical time, with automatic and semi-automatic methods that require ad hoc sampling strategies and/or instrumentation. Therefore, video survey analysis of benthic marine habitat is largely restricted to a limited subset of photograms, often extracted manually. By comparing video frame extractions performed at regular time and distance intervals, this chapter explores how ROV video subset methods may affect the estimation of the substrate cover extent and the taxonomical composition of the biological communities, with the aim to identify an efficient compromise between analytical effort and quality of results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Soil temperatures play an important role in determining the distribution and function of organisms. However, soil temperature is decoupled from air temperature and varies widely in space. Characterizing and predicting soil temperature requires large and expensive networks of data loggers. We developed an open-source soil temperature data logger and created online resources to ensure our design was accessible. We tested data loggers constructed by students, with little prior electronics experience, in the lab, and in the field in Alaska. The do-it-yourself (DIY) data logger was comparably accurate to a commercial system with a mean absolute error of 2% from −20–0◦C and 1% from 0–20◦C. They captured accurate soil temperature data and performed reliably in the field with less than 10% failing in the first year of deployment. The DIY loggers were ~1.7–7 times less expensive than commercial systems. This work has the potential to increase the spatial resolution of soil temperature monitoring and serve as a powerful educational tool. The DIY soil temperature data logger will reduce data collection costs and improve our understanding of species distributions and ecological processes. It also provides an educational resource to enhance STEM, accessibility, inclusivity, and engagement. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Two expanding areas of science and technology are citizen science and three-dimensional (3D) printing. Citizen science has a proven capability to generate reliable data and contribute to unexpected scientific discovery. It can put science into the hands of the citizens, increasing understanding, promoting environmental stewardship, and leading to the production of large databases for use in environmental monitoring. 3D printing has the potential to create cheap, bespoke scientific instruments that have formerly required dedicated facilities to assemble. It can put instrument manufacturing into the hands of any citizen who has access to a 3D printer. In this paper, we present a simple hand-held device designed to measure the Secchi depth and water colour (Forel Ule scale) of lake, estuarine and nearshore regions. The device is manufactured with marine resistant materials (mostly biodegradable) using a 3D printer and basic workshop tools. It is inexpensive to manufacture, lightweight, easy to use, and accessible to a wide range of users. It builds on a long tradition in optical limnology and oceanography, but is modified for ease of operation in smaller water bodies, and from small watercraft and platforms. We provide detailed instructions on how to build the device and highlight examples of its use for scientific education, citizen science, satellite validation of ocean colour data, and low-cost monitoring of water clarity, colour and temperature. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure plays an increasingly significant role in sustainable urban development planning as it provides important regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Monitoring of such dynamic and complex systems requires technological solutions which provide easy data collection, processing, and utilization at affordable costs. To meet these challenges a pilot study was conducted using a network of wireless, low cost, and multiparameter monitoring devices, which operate using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to provide real-time monitoring of regulatory ecosystem services in the form of meaningful indicators for both human health and environmental policies. The pilot study was set in a green area situated in the center of Moscow, which is exposed to the heat island effect as well as high levels of anthropogenic pressure. Sixteen IoT devices were installed on individual trees to monitor their ecophysiological parameters from 1 July to 31 November 2019 with a time resolution of 1.5 h. These parameters were used as input variables to quantify indicators of ecosystem services related to climate, air quality, and water regulation. Our results showed that the average tree in the study area during the investigated period reduced extreme heat by 2 °C via shading, cooled the surrounding area by transferring 2167 ± 181 KWh of incoming solar energy into latent heat, transpired 137 ± 49 mm of water, sequestered 8.61 ± 1.25 kg of atmospheric carbon, and removed 5.3 ± 0.8 kg of particulate matter (PM10). The values of the monitored processes varied spatially and temporally when considering different tree species (up to five to ten times), local environmental conditions, and seasonal weather. Thus, it is important to use real-time monitoring data to deepen understandings of the processes of urban forests. There is a new opportunity of applying IoT technology not only to measure trees functionality through fluxes of water and carbon, but also to establish a smart urban green infrastructure operational system for management. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Street view imagery has rapidly ascended as an important data source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, deriving insights and supporting informed decisions. Such surge has been mainly catalysed by the proliferation of large-scale imagery platforms, advances in computer vision and machine learning, and availability of computing resources. We screened more than 600 recent papers to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the state of the art of how street-level imagery is currently used in studies pertaining to the built environment. The main findings are that: (i) street view imagery is now clearly an entrenched component of urban analytics and GIScience; (ii) most of the research relies on data from Google Street View; and (iii) it is used across myriads of domains with numerous applications – ranging from analysing vegetation and transportation to health and socio-economic studies. A notable trend is crowdsourced street view imagery, facilitated by services such as Mapillary and KartaView, in some cases furthering geographical coverage and temporal granularity, at a permissive licence. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Advances in remote sensing (RS) technology in recent years have increased the interest in including RS data into one-class classifiers (OCCs). However, this integration is complex given the interdisciplinary issues involved. In this context, this review highlights the advances and current challenges in integrating RS data into OCCs to map vegetation classes. A systematic review was performed for the period 2013–2020. A total of 136 articles were analyzed based on 11 topics and 30 attributes that address the ecological issues, properties of RS data, and the tools and parameters used to classify natural vegetation. The results highlight several advances in the use of RS data in OCCs: (i) mapping of potential and actual vegetation areas, (ii) long-term monitoring of vegetation classes, (iii) generation of multiple ecological variables, (iv) availability of open-source data, (v) reduction in plotting effort, and (vi) quantification of over-detection. Recommendations related to interdisciplinary issues were also suggested: (i) increasing the visibility and use of available RS variables, (ii) following good classification practices, (iii) bridging the gap between spatial resolution and site extent, and (iv) classifying plant communities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Nearshore coastal waters are among the most dynamic regions on the planet and difficult to sample from conventional oceanographic platforms. It has been suggested that environmental sampling of the nearshore could be improved by mobilising vast numbers of citizens who partake in marine recreational sports, like surfing. In this paper, we compared two approaches for measuring sea surface temperature (SST), an Essential Climate Variable, when surfing. One technique involved attaching a commercially-available miniature temperature logger (Onset UTBI-001 TidbiT v2) to the leash of the surfboard (tether connecting surfer and surfboard) and the second, attaching a surfboard fin (Smartfin) that contained an environmental sensor package. Between July 2017 and July 2018, 148 surfing sessions took place, 90 in the southwest UK and 58 in San Diego, California, USA. During these sessions, both Smartfin and leash sensors were deployed simultaneously. On the leash, two TidbiT v2 sensors were attached, one with (denoted LP) and one without (denoted LU) a protective boot, designed to shield the sensor from sunlight. The median temperature from each technique, during each surfing session, was extracted and compared along with independent water temperature data from a nearby pier and benthic logger, and matched with photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) data from satellite observations (used as a proxy for solar radiation during each surf). Results indicate a mean difference ((Formula presented.)) of 0.13 °C and mean absolute difference ((Formula presented.)) of 0.14 °C between Smartfin and LU, and a (Formula presented.) of 0.04 °C and an (Formula presented.) of 0.06 °C between Smartfin and LP. For UK measurements, we observed better agreement between methods ((Formula presented.) °C and (Formula presented.) °C between Smartfin and LU, and (Formula presented.) °C and (Formula presented.) °C between Smartfin and LP) when compared with measurements in San Diego ((Formula presented.) °C and (Formula presented.) °C between Smartfin and LU, and (Formula presented.) °C and (Formula presented.) °C between Smartfin and LP). Surfing SST data were found to agree well, in general, with independent temperature data from a nearby pier and benthic logger. Differences in SST between leash and Smartfin were found to correlate with PAR, both for the unprotected (LU) and protected (LP) TidbiT v2 sensors, explaining the regional differences in the comparison (PAR generally higher during US surfing sessions than UK sessions). Considering that the Smartfin is sheltered from ambient light by the surfboard, unlike the leash, results indicate the leash TidbiT v2 sensors warm with exposure to sunlight biasing the SST data positively, a result consistent with published tests on similar sensors in shallow waters. We matched all LU data collected prior to this study with satellite PAR products and corrected for solar heating. Results highlight the need to design temperature sensor packages that minimise exposure from solar heating when towed in the surface ocean. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Assessing patterns and processes of plant functional, taxonomic, genetic, and structural biodiversity at large scales is essential across many disciplines, including ecosystem management, agriculture, ecosystem risk and service assessment, conservation science, and forestry. In situ data housed in databases necessary to perform such assessments over large parts of the world are growing steadily. Integrating these in situ data with remote sensing (RS) products helps not only to improve data completeness and quality but also to account for limitations and uncertainties associated with each data product. Here, we outline how auxiliary environmental and socioeconomic data might be integrated with biodiversity and RS data to expand our knowledge about ecosystem functioning and inform the conservation of biodiversity. We discuss concepts, data, and methods necessary to assess plant species and ecosystem properties across scales of space and time and provide a critical discussion of outstanding issues. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - There are many new land use and land cover (LULC) products emerging yet there is still a lack of in situ data for training, validation, and change detection purposes. The LUCAS (Land Use Cover Area frame Sample) survey is one of the few authoritative in situ field campaigns, which takes place every three years in European Union member countries. More recently, a study has considered whether citizen science and crowdsourcing could complement LUCAS survey data, e.g., through the FotoQuest Austria mobile app and crowdsourcing campaign. Although the data obtained from the campaign were promising when compared with authoritative LUCAS survey data, there were classes that were not well classified by the citizens. Moreover, the photographs submitted through the app were not always of sufficient quality. For these reasons, in the latest FotoQuest Go Europe 2018 campaign, several improvements were made to the app to facilitate interaction with the citizens contributing and to improve their accuracy in LULC identification. In addition to extending the locations from Austria to Europe, a change detection component (comparing land cover in 2018 to the 2015 LUCAS photographs) was added, as well as an improved LC decision tree. Furthermore, a near real-time quality assurance system was implemented to provide feedback on the distance to the target location, the LULC classes chosen and the quality of the photographs. Another modification was a monetary incentive scheme in which users received between 1 to 3 Euros for each successfully completed quest of sufficient quality. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether citizens can provide high quality in situ data on LULC through crowdsourcing that can complement LUCAS. We compared the results between the FotoQuest campaigns in 2015 and 2018 and found a significant improvement in 2018, i.e., a much higher match of LC between FotoQuest Go Europe and LUCAS. As shown by the cost comparisons with LUCAS, FotoQuest can complement LUCAS surveys by enabling continuous collection of large amounts of high quality, spatially explicit field data at a low cost. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Accuracy assessment and land cover mapping have been inexorably linked throughout the first 50 years of publication of Remote Sensing of Environment. The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically, practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a mature state. However, documentation of accuracy assessment methods needs to be improved to enhance reproducibility and transparency, and improved methods are required to address new challenges created by advanced technology that has expanded the capacity to map land cover extensively in space and intensively in time. © 2019

AB  - Climate-smart forestry (CSF) is an emerging branch of sustainable adaptive forest management aimed at enhancing the potential of forests to adapt to and mitigate climate change. It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest managers in this new generation of forest monitoring. © Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - Kelps (Laminariales, Ochrophyta) are ecologically and commercially important habitat-forming brown macroalgae, found in coastal ecosystems worldwide. Their presence in the sublittoral fringe makes monitoring kelp forests problematic and consequently they remain relatively understudied. Remote sensing offers new avenues to monitor difficult-to-access biomes, particularly kelp habitats, but previous monitoring efforts have only been tested on an ad hoc basis and a standardized protocol for monitoring kelp requires development. In view of on-going and emerging threats to kelp, there is a need for monitoring to establish detailed baseline information. Wild harvesting of kelp is increasing, illustrated by growing numbers of seaweed and seaweed-containing products. Simultaneously, climate change is causing sea-surface temperatures to rise and influencing kelp distribution and abundance globally. This study reviews the potential for remote sensing in macroalgal studies, with an emphasis on kelp and provides a conceptual framework to support the development of standardized monitoring protocols. Satellite-born sensors and aerial photography have been effective, but these distant sensors cannot operate effectively in turbid temperate waters, and many image surveys do not account for changing tides. Advances are being made in acoustic monitoring, particularly multibeam sound navigation and ranging (SONAR). With some development, there is great potential for a standardized monitoring protocol for kelp, aiding management and conservation efforts. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin is a hot spot of climate change where the Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (PO) and other seagrasses are under stress due to its effect on marine coastal habitats and the rising influence of anthropogenic activities (i.e., tourism, fishery). The PO and seabed ecosystems, in the coastal environments of Pantelleria and Lampedusa, suffer additional growing impacts from tourism in synergy with specific stress factors due to increasing vessel traffic for supplying potable water and fossil fuels for electrical power generation. Earth Observation (EO) data, provided by high resolution (HR) multi/hyperspectral operative satellite sensors of the last generation (i.e., Sentinel 2 MSI and PRISMA) have been successfully tested, using innovative calibration and sea truth collecting methods, for monitoring and mapping of PO meadows under stress, in the coastal waters of these islands, located in the Sicily Channel, to better support the sustainable management of these vulnerable ecosystems. The area of interest in Pantelleria was where the first prototype of the Italian Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter (ISWEC) for renewable energy production was installed in 2015, and sea truth campaigns on the PO meadows were conducted. The PO of Lampedusa coastal areas, impacted by ship traffic linked to the previous factors and tropicalization effects of Italy’s southernmost climate change transitional zone, was mapped through a multi/hyper spectral EO-based approach, using training/testing data provided by side scan sonar data, previously acquired. Some advanced machine learning algorithms (MLA) were successfully evaluated with different supervised regression/classification models to map seabed and PO meadow classes and related Leaf Area Index (LAI) distributions in the areas of interest, using multi/hyperspectral data atmospherically corrected via different advanced approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Marine citizen science is emerging with promising opportunities for science, policy and public but there is still no comprehensive overview of the current state in Europe. Based on 127 projects identified for the North Sea area we estimate there might be as much as 500 marine and coastal citizen science projects running in Europe, i.e., one marine citizen science project per ∼85 km of coastline, with an exponential growth since 1990. Beach-based projects are more accessible and hence most popular (60% of the projects), and the mean duration of the projects is 18–20 years. Current trends, topics, organizers, aims, and types of programme in terms of participation are presented in this overview. Progress in marine citizen science is specially enabled and promoted through technological developments. Recent technological advances and best practise examples are provided here, untapping the potential of smart mobile apps, do-it-yourself (DIY) technologies, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI) web services. © Copyright © 2021 Garcia-Soto, Seys, Zielinski, Busch, Luna, Baez, Domegan, Dubsky, Kotynska-Zielinska, Loubat, Malfatti, Mannaerts, McHugh, Monestiez, van der Meeren and Gorsky.

AB  - The timing of spring phenology marks the start of the growing season and the beginning of the carbon-uptake period. In order to accurately calculate carbon budgets across different vegetation types, reliable start-of-season data over relatively large areas is necessary. However, in-situ phenological observation networks are generally restricted in their geographical extent and limited to a small number of species, typically dominant trees. Satellite remote sensing can provide spatially extensive phenological information but requires validation with in-situ observations. Here, we examined trends (1968–2016) in the timing of leaf-unfolding (LU) as well as growing-season-length (GSL), derived from in-situ observations, of a suite of deciduous trees, at three rural sites and one urban site in Ireland, all of which are within the International Phenological Gardens network. We compared in-situ trends with satellite derived phenometrics, including start of greening increase and GSL, based on two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) from a combined AVHRR and MODIS time-series over the time period 1982–2016. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing in capturing LU and GSL as determined by in-situ observations from sites dominated by varying land cover types. The timing of LU (DOY 111) at the urban site was significantly (p < 0.000) later than all rural sites, apart from one (1982–2016). The significantly (p < 0.000) longer (2–5 weeks) GSL (217 days), at the urban site, was thus driven by delayed leaf fall (LF). Satellite derived Start of Season (SOS) was consistently earlier than LU across all sites (RMSE 25–52d; MBE −5 to −50 d) whereas EVI2-derived GSL was consistently longer than in situ data (RMSE 65–102d; MBE 45 to 96 d). Overall, the discrepancies reported here between the timing of in-situ spring phenology and satellite-derived phenometrics at these sites were possibly due to a combination of factors including differences in scale between the two methods, the small number of cloned trees being monitored, which does not appear to represent the broader landscape vegetation, the heterogeneity of the landscape and technical differences between the satellite sensors used to construct the EVI2 time-series. Addressing these issues is challenging but engaging citizen scientists to monitor local vegetation would increase the spatial coverage of the in-situ observation network while also incorporating a broader range of species some of which would undoubtedly represent native vegetation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Two common approaches to conserving biodiversity are conserving the actors (species) and conserving the stage (habitat). Many management efforts focus on conserving the actors, but a major challenge to this strategy is uncertainty surrounding how species’ geographic ranges might shift in response to global change, including climate and land use change. The Nature Conservancy has moved to conserving the stage, with the aim of maintaining the processes that generate and support biodiversity. This strategy requires knowing how biodiversity responds to geodiversity-the abiotic features and processes that define the stage. Here we explore how remote sensing illuminates the relationship between biodiversity and geodiversity. We introduce a variety of geodiversity measures and discuss how they can be combined with biodiversity data. We then explore the relationship between biodiversity and geodiversity with tree biodiversity data from the US Forest Inventory and Analysis Program and geodiversity data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission as a case study and proof of concept. We find that whereas beta diversity was not well explained by geodiversity, both alpha and gamma diversities were positively related to geodiversity. We also outline the challenges and opportunities of using remote sensing to understand the relationship between biodiversity and geodiversity. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The diversity of life in the sea is critical to the health of ocean ecosystems that support living resources and therefore essential to the economic, nutritional, recreational, and health needs of billions of people. Yet there is evidence that the biodiversity of many marine habitats is being altered in response to a changing climate and human activity. Understanding this change, and forecasting where changes are likely to occur, requires monitoring of organism diversity, distribution, abundance, and health. It requires a minimum of measurements including productivity and ecosystem function, species composition, allelic diversity, and genetic expression. These observations need to be complemented with metrics of environmental change and socio-economic drivers. However, existing global ocean observing infrastructure and programs often do not explicitly consider observations of marine biodiversity and associated processes. Much effort has focused on physical, chemical and some biogeochemical measurements. Broad partnerships, shared approaches, and best practices are now being organized to implement an integrated observing system that serves information to resource managers and decision-makers, scientists and educators, from local to global scales. This integrated observing system of ocean life is now possible due to recent developments among satellite, airborne, and in situ sensors in conjunction with increases in information system capability and capacity, along with an improved understanding of marine processes represented in new physical, biogeochemical, and biological models. © 2019 Canonico, Buttigieg, Montes, Muller-Karger, Stepien, Wright, Benson, Helmuth, Costello, Sousa-Pinto, Saeedi, Newton, Appeltans, Bednaršek, Bodrossy, Best, Brandt, Goodwin, Iken, Marques, Miloslavich, Ostrowski, Turner, Achterberg, Barry, Defeo, Bigatti, Henry, Ramiro-Sánchez, Durán, Morato, Roberts, García-Alegre, Cuadrado and Murton.

AB  - Terrestrial protected areas (PAs) play an essential role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological processes worldwide, and the monitoring of PAs is a useful tool in assessing the effectiveness of PA management. Advanced remote sensing technologies have been increasingly used for mapping and monitoring the dynamics of PAs. We review the advances in remote sensing-based approaches for monitoring terrestrial PAs in the last decade and identify four types of studies in this field: land use & land cover and vegetation community classification, vegetation structure quantification, natural disturbance monitoring, and land use & land cover and vegetation dynamic analysis. We systematically discuss the satellite data and methods used for monitoring PAs for the four research objectives. Moreover, we summarize the approaches used in the different types of studies. The following suggestions are provided for future studies: (1) development of remote sensing frameworks for local PA monitoring worldwide; (2) comprehensive utilization of multisource remote sensing data; (3) improving methods to investigate the details of PA dynamics; (4) discovering the driving forces and providing measures for PA management. Overall, the integration of remote sensing data and advanced processing methods can support PAmanagement and decision-making procedures. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications. © 2019

AB  - Vegetation mapping requires extensive field data for training and validation. Volunteered geographic information in the form of geotagged photos of identified plants has the potential to serve as a supplemental data source for vegetation mapping projects. In this study, we compare the locations of specific taxa from the iNaturalist platform to locations identified on both a fine-scale vegetation map and high-resolution ortho-imagery in open-canopy shrubland in San Clemente Island, CA. Due to positional uncertainty associated with the iNaturalist observations, as well as the presence-only nature of the data, it was not possible to perform a traditional accuracy assessment. We instead measured the distance between the location recorded by an iNaturalist observer for a given taxon and the closest mapped individual of that taxon. This distance was within 10 m for a majority of the observations (64%). When comparing the iNaturalist location to the closest individual detected through image interpretation, 87% of the observations were within 10 m. The discrepancy in agreement between the vegetation map and imagery is likely due to mapping errors. While iNaturalist data come with important limitations, the platform is an excellent resource for supporting vegetation mapping and other ecological applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper aims at discussing the importance of environmental factors in the stability of communities at local scale. Two case studies, referred to two medieval monastic communities are chosen as historical examples, under low-carbon conditions, to show the effects of the interplay between a lack of Community Based Adaptation (CBA) and difficult or changing environmental conditions. The case studies refer to the monastery of Bobbio (Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna, Italy) and Castelletto Cervo (Biella, Piedmont, Italy). In particular, the first case shows a lack of transformation of harsh regulations to the difficult environmental conditions of that time, which leaded to a revolt inside the monastery. On the other side, the decline of Castelletto Cervo Cluniac priory depended upon a bad management of economic resources in a time of environmental variability, which affected the agricultural yield and the life of many villages in the considered area. The choice analyzing the case of two low-carbon communities (i.e.: before the XVI century, when the massive diffusion and use of coal modified these conditions) depends on the present international political will and plans of decarbonizing our societal lifestyles. This research highlights the hidden environmental causes behind the social instability and, in one case, the collapse of the community. Besides further reasons for historical interest, which are not deepened in this research, these case studies show that environmental factors are often unseen or neglected in planning the life of a community, also exerting a strong influence on real economy at local level. In order to develop appropriate policies to guarantee a long-term resilience for the socio-ecological stability of communities, an adequate monitoring of appropriate environmental and social parameters can sup-port planning activities. © 2019 L & H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

AB  - Data contributed by a large number of non-experts is increasingly used to validate and curate land cover data, with location-based games (LBGs) developed for this purpose generating particular interest. We here present our findings on StarBorn, a novel LBG with a strong focus on game play. Users conquer game-tiles by visiting real-world locations and collecting land cover data. Within three months, StarBorn generated 13,319 land cover classifications by 84 users. Results show that data are concentrated around users’ daily life spaces, agreement among users is highest for urban and industry land cover, and user-generated land cover classifications exhibit high agreement with an authoritative data set. However, we also observe low user retention rates and negative correlations between number of contributions and agreement rates with an authoritative land cover product. We recommend that future work consider not only game play, but also how motivational aspects influence behavior and data quality. We conclude that LBGs are suitable tools for generating cost-efficient in-situ land cover classifications. © 2019 The Authors. Transactions in GIS Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Pedometrics, the application of mathematical and statistical methods to the study of the distribution and genesis of soils, has broadened its scope over the past two decades. The primary focus of pedometricians has traditionally been on spatial and spatio-temporal soil inventories with numerical soil classification, geostatistical modelling of spatial variation and mapping. The rapid development of remote and proximal soil sensing as well as data-driven statistical modelling techniques have had a major impact on pedometrics over the past decades. During this time, a general demand for quantitative digital soil information for environmental modelling and management has compelled pedometricians to address other soil-related questions from a quantitative point of view: soil genesis and utility and quality of soil. While scientific progress is largely an autonomous process that is difficult to steer, research efforts could benefit from an agenda with pressing pedometric research topics. This paper defines and discusses ten recent or longstanding pedometrics challenges, with the attempt to identify knowledge gaps and suggest new concepts and methods to overcome them. The ten challenges were selected through a collaborative effort and may serve as a guidance for future pedometrics research and to foster collaboration among soil scientists. The challenges discussed in this paper are also indicators of the current understanding and state of knowledge from which progress can be measured in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Applying physiological tools, knowledge and concepts to understand conservation problems (i.e. conservation physiology) has becomecommonplace and confers an ability to understand mechanistic processes,develop predictive models and identify cause-and-effect relationships. Conservation physiology is making contributions to conservation solutions; the number of 'success stories' is growing, but there remain unexplored opportunities for which conservation physiology shows immense promise and has the potential to contribute to major advances in protecting and restoring biodiversity. Here, we consider howconservation physiology has evolved with a focus on reframing the discipline to be more inclusive and integrative.Using a 'horizon scan',we further exploreways in which conservation physiology can be more relevant to pressing conservation issues of today (e.g. addressing the Sustainable Development Goals; delivering science to support the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration), aswell as more forward-looking to inform emerging issues and policies for tomorrow. Our horizon scan provides evidence that, as the discipline of conservation physiology continues to mature, it provides a wealth of opportunities to promote integration, inclusivity and forward-thinking goals that contribute to achieving conservation gains. To advance environmentalmanagementand ecosystemrestoration,we need to ensure that the underlying science (such as that generated by conservation physiology) is relevant with accompanying messaging that is straightforward and accessible to end users. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Passive acoustic recorders have been used successfully as automated survey tools to detect terrestrial wildlife. However, few studies have monitored Neotropical migratory bird use of riparian forest habitat using this technology. Within dryland ecosystems, the forests along rivers support high bird diversity. Many bird species of conservation concern require these floodplain forest habitats for foraging, migration stop-overs, and breeding. Few studies have explored the use of acoustic records in riverine systems designated for conservation for their natural resource value via the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in the USA. Using acoustic recorders, we document vocal activity of four riparian-obligate species (Bell’s Vireo, Vireo bellii; Summer Tanager, Piranga rubra; Yellow Warbler, Setophaga petechial; and Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus) to determine species occurrence along a Wild and Scenic River. We established three study reaches along the perennial Lower Verde River, in the Sonoran Desert of central Arizona, USA. Nine acoustic recorders were used over the period of 80–120 days during the summer of 2018. We measured vegetation composition and structure in 100 m2 plots paired with acoustic recorders. Visualizing vocal activity showed that three species were calling and singing at each reach; whereas, one species, the cuckoo, had fewer recordings and occurred later in the summer. We demonstrate the utility of acoustic monitoring even when applied to rare birds in complex riparian habitats. This information is important for land management and conservation efforts concerning these species of interest and identifying important habitat features in Southwestern US riparian woodlands. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiversity surveys are often required for development projects in cities that could affect protected species such as bats. Bats are important biodiversity indicators of the wider health of the environment and activity surveys of bat species are used to report on the performance of mitigation actions. Typically, sensors are used in the field to listen to the ultrasonic echolocation calls of bats or the audio data is recorded for post-processing to calculate the activity levels. Current methods rely on significant human input and therefore present an opportunity for continuous monitoring and in situ machine learning detection of bat calls in the field. Here, we show the results from a longitudinal study of 15 novel Internet connected bat sensors—Echo Boxes—in a large urban park. The study provided empirical evidence of how edge processing can reduce network traffic and storage demands by several orders of magnitude, making it possible to run continuous monitoring activities for many months including periods which traditionally would not be monitored. Our results demonstrate how the combination of artificial intelligence techniques and low-cost sensor networks can be used to create novel insights for ecologists and conservation decision-makers. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Mountainous regions are globally important, in part because they support large populations and are biodiverse. They are also characterized by enhanced vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures and sensitivity to climate change. This importance necessitates the development of a global reference network of long-term environmental and socioeconomic monitoring-mountain observatories. At present, monitoring is limited and unevenly distributed across mountain regions globally. Existing thematic networks do not fully support the generation of multidisciplinary knowledge required to inform decisions, enact drivers of sustainable development, and safeguard against losses. In this paper, the Mountain Observatories Working Group, established by the Mountain Research Initiative (MRI) Science Leadership Council, identifies geographical and thematic gaps as well as recent advances in monitoring of relevant biophysical and socioeconomic variables in the mountains. We propose principles and ways of connecting existing initiatives, supporting emerging areas, and developing new mountain observatory networks regionally and, eventually, globally. Particularly in the data-poor regions, we aspire to build a community of researchers and practitioners in collaboration with the Global Network on Observations and Information in Mountain Environments, Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Mountains, a GEO Work Programme Initiative. © 2021 International Mountain Society.

AB  - Advances in agricultural data production provide ever-increasing opportunities for pushing the research frontier in agricultural economics and designing better agricultural policy. As new technologies present opportunities to create new and integrated data sources, researchers face tradeoffs in survey design that may reduce measurement error or increase coverage. In this chapter, we first review the econometric and survey methodology literatures that focus on the sources of measurement error and coverage bias in agricultural data collection. Second, we provide examples of how agricultural data structure affects testable empirical models. Finally, we review the challenges and opportunities offered by technological innovation to meet old and new data demands and address key empirical questions, focusing on the scalable data innovations of greatest potential impact for empirical methods and research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vulture populations in India have been reduced by the occurrence of diclofenac poisoning, habitat degradation and climatic variation. An effective assessment of the status of Indian vultures requires a methodology including literature study, field research and the mapping of the changing ranges and habitat distributions of the various species. This chapter investigates the evidence for the decline of vulture populations in India, taking a case study of Central India, a stronghold for vulture populations. The study is based on a survey of the literature on vulture population counts, ranging and habitat mapping and predictive models of vulture presence. It investigates the status of endangered vulture species, their conservation requirements, the data collection methodologies and technology required for such assessments. Maps of vulture distribution and ecological relations are presented and discussed. Vulture conservation policies are also explored. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - As the largest river basin on Earth, the Amazon is of major importance to the world's climate and water resources. Over the past decades, advances in satellite-based remote sensing (RS) have brought our understanding of its terrestrial water cycle and the associated hydrological processes to a new era. Here, we review major studies and the various techniques using satellite RS in the Amazon. We show how RS played a major role in supporting new research and key findings regarding the Amazon water cycle, and how the region became a laboratory for groundbreaking investigations of new satellite retrievals and analyses. At the basin-scale, the understanding of several hydrological processes was only possible with the advent of RS observations, such as the characterization of "rainfall hotspots" in the Andes-Amazon transition, evapotranspiration rates, and variations of surface waters and groundwater storage. These results strongly contribute to the recent advances of hydrological models and to our new understanding of the Amazon water budget and aquatic environments. In the context of upcoming hydrology-oriented satellite missions, which will offer the opportunity for new synergies and new observations with finer space-time resolution, this review aims to guide future research agenda toward integrated monitoring and understanding of the Amazon water from space. Integrated multidisciplinary studies, fostered by international collaborations, set up future directions to tackle the great challenges the Amazon is currently facing, from climate change to increased anthropogenic pressure. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Intensifying pressure on global aquatic resources and services due to population growth and climate change is inspiring new surveying technologies to provide science-based information in support of management and policy strategies. One area of rapid development is hyperspectral remote sensing: imaging across the full spectrum of visible and infrared light. Hyperspectral imagery contains more environmentally meaningful information than panchromatic or multispectral imagery and is poised to provide new applications relevant to society, including assessments of aquatic biodiversity, habitats, water quality, and natural and anthropogenic hazards. To aid in these advances, we provide resources relevant to hyperspectral remote sensing in terms of providing the latest reviews, databases, and software available for practitioners in the field. We highlight recent advances in sensor design, modes of deployment, and image analysis techniques that are becoming more widely available to environmental researchers and resource managers alike. Systems recently deployed on space- and airborne platforms are presented, as well as future missions and advances in unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous in-water survey methods. These systems will greatly enhance the ability to collect interdisciplinary observations on-demand and in previously inaccessible environments. Looking forward, advances in sensor miniaturization are discussed alongside the incorporation of citizen science, moving toward open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data. Advances in machine learning and cloud computing allow for exploitation of the full electromagnetic spectrum, and better bridging across the larger scientific community that also includes biogeochemical modelers and climate scientists. These advances will place sophisticated remote sensing capabilities into the hands of individual users and provide on-demand imagery tailored to research and management requirements, as well as provide critical input to marine and climate forecasting systems. The next decade of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we assess and monitor aquatic environments and detect changes relevant to global communities. © Copyright © 2021 Dierssen, Ackleson, Joyce, Hestir, Castagna, Lavender and McManus.

AB  - Coral reefs are exceptionally biodiverse and human dependence on their ecosystem services is high. Reefs experience significant direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures, and provide a sensitive indicator of coastal ocean health, climate change, and ocean acidification, with associated implications for society. Monitoring coral reef status and trends is essential to better inform science, management and policy, but the projected collapse of reef systems within a few decades makes the provision of accurate and actionable monitoring data urgent. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has been the foundation for global reporting on coral reefs for two decades, and is entering into a new phase with improved operational and data standards incorporating the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) (www.goosocean.org/eov) and Framework for Ocean Observing developed by the Global Ocean Observing System. Three EOVs provide a robust description of reef health: hard coral cover and composition, macro-algal canopy cover, and fish diversity and abundance. A data quality model based on comprehensive metadata has been designed to facilitate maximum global coverage of coral reef data, and tangible steps to track capacity building. Improved monitoring of events such as mass bleaching and disease outbreaks, citizen science, and socio-economic monitoring have the potential to greatly improve the relevance of monitoring to managers and stakeholders, and to address the complex and multi-dimensional interactions between reefs and people. A new generation of autonomous vehicles (underwater, surface, and aerial) and satellites are set to revolutionize and vastly expand our understanding of coral reefs. Promising approaches include Structure from Motion image processing, and acoustic techniques. Across all systems, curation of data in linked and open online databases, with an open data culture to maximize benefits from data integration, and empowering users to take action, are priorities. Action in the next decade will be essential to mitigate the impacts on coral reefs from warming temperatures, through local management and informing national and international obligations, particularly in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, climate action, and the role of coral reefs as a global indicator. Mobilizing data to help drive the needed behavior change is a top priority for coral reef observing systems. © 2019 Obura, Aeby, Amornthammarong, Appeltans, Bax, Bishop, Brainard, Chan, Fletcher, Gordon, Gramer, Gudka, Halas, Hendee, Hodgson, Huang, Jankulak, Jones, Kimura, Levy, Miloslavich, Chou, Muller-Karger, Osuka, Samoilys, Simpson, Tun and Wongbusarakum.

AB  - As environmental change in the Arctic accelerates, there is a growing need to accurately quantify the response of Arctic ecosystems throughout the year. To assess the temporal coverage of observations of carbon and nutrient fluxes, we used literature synthesis, quantitative meta-analysis, and exploration of a novel biogeochemical dataset from one of the best-documented Arctic ecosystems: the headwaters of the Kuparuk River in Northern Alaska. The meta-analysis of 204 peer-reviewed studies revealed a strong temporal gap in observations of biogeochemistry and hydrology of the Kuparuk River, with substantially fewer observations from the early and late ‘shoulders’ of the thaw season (defined as the period before snowmelt or after plant senescence). To test and illustrate how much this bias might influence fundamental ecosystem level measurements, such as riverine carbon and nutrient fluxes, we used high-frequency, in-situ water chemistry sensors to estimate riverine export budgets across the thaw season for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3−) in the Kuparuk headwaters. With this novel dataset, we found that a large proportion (~30%) of the annual export of DOC and NO3− occurred during the shoulder seasons, which are not well characterized even for this well-documented Arctic system. These analyses raise the broader question: what ecological information are we missing by giving these seasons the ‘cold shoulder’? As climate change alters seasonality, filling this major data gap in the shoulder seasons is crucial to understand the response of Arctic ecosystems. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrological monitoring is essential to guide evidence-based decision making necessary for sustainable water resource management and governance. Limited hydrometric datasets and the pressure on long-term hydrological monitoring networks make it paramount to explore alternative methods for data collection. This is particularly the case for low-income countries, where data scarcity is more pronounced, and where conventional monitoring methods are expensive and logistically challenging. Citizen science in hydrological research has recently gained popularity and crowdsourced monitoring is a promising cost-effective approach for data collection. Citizen science also has the potential to enhance knowledge co-creation and science-based evidence that underpins the governance and management of water resources. This paper provides a comprehensive review on citizen science and crowdsourced data collection within the context of hydrology, based on a synthesis of 71 articles from 2001 to 2018. Application of citizen science in hydrology is increasing in number and breadth, generating a plethora of scientific data. Citizen science approaches differ in scale, scope and degree of citizen involvement. Most of the programs are found in North America and Europe. Participation mostly comprises a contributory citizen science model, which engages citizens in data collection. In order to leverage the full potential of citizen science in knowledge co-generation, future citizen science projects in hydrology could benefit from more co-created types of projects that establish strong ties between research and public engagement, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of monitoring networks. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Invasive plant species in eastern Africa severely impede rangeland and cropland productivity with dire consequences for livelihoods of agro-pastoralist communities. We produced the first occurrence and spread map of invasive plant species (Prosopis: Prosopis juliflora and Parthenium: Parthenium hysterophorus) for western Somaliland (a region of eastern Africa) using vegetation productivity and phenology trends from 250 m MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data (2001–2014). Binomial logistic regression models were created to predict the presence or absence of the invasive species from the MODIS EVI phenometrics and vegetation productivity trends. Model training pixels were extracted from a 30 m Landsat-based classification that mapped areas of propagation of the two invasive species between 2001 and 2015. Field observations collected during 2014 and 2015 were used as reference data for the Landsat classification. After optimization of the logistic regression models, a probability of occurrence map was produced and evaluated for each of the two invasive species. The probability maps predicted that the cropland-dominated areas in the southwestern part of Somaliland were considerably infested with Parthenium while Prosopis was most abundant in the peri-urban zones and the central and eastern regions. Vegetation amplitude (the seasonal cycle of vegetation between the vegetation peak and the trough) was most relevant and statistically significant for predicting the spread of Parthenium. This highlights the importance of vegetation seasonality variables for the wide-area mapping of herbaceous life forms in semi-arid biomes. Mann-Kendall trends based on annual summed EVI value and seasonal EVI peak value trends were the most relevant predictors for the occurrence of Prosopis. Phenometric trends show immense potential to map shifts in vegetation patterns in relation to the spread of invasive species as a consequence of global change effects, particularly in African drylands. © 2019

AB  - In this paper, we critically review the current state-of-the-art for sensor network applications and approaches that have developed in response to the recent rise of low-cost technologies. We specifically focus on water-related low-cost sensor networks, and conceptualize them as socio-technical systems that can address resource management challenges and opportunities at three scales of resolution: (1) technologies, (2) users and scenarios, and (3) society and communities. Building this argument, first we identify a general structure for building low-cost sensor networks by assembling technical components across configuration levels. Second, we identify four application categories, namely operational monitoring, scientific research, system optimization, and community development, each of which has different technical and nontechnical configurations that determine how, where, by whom, and for what purpose low-cost sensor networks are used. Third, we discuss the governance factors (e.g., stakeholders and users, networks sustainability and maintenance, application scenarios, and integrated design) and emerging technical opportunities that we argue need to be considered to maximize the added value and long-term societal impact of the next generation of sensor network applications. We conclude that consideration of the full range of socio-technical issues is essential to realize the full potential of sensor network technologies for society and the environment.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing (RS) is useful to indirectly evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of land uses, land-cover changes, aboveground biomass of vegetation, leaf-area index of terrestrial vegetation canopies, and plant phenology. These observations allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem structure, ecosystem functions, and biodiversity under climate change. However, satellite RS observations include uncertainties and other issues, and our ecological understanding of satellite RS-observed data is still insufficient. To solve these issues and to better understand the ecological meaning, we need to collect abundant ground-truth data from multiple field sites to validate satellite RS-observed data and conduct integrated analyses using both types. To enhance the development of phenology observation and land-use and land-cover change studies, the Phenological Eyes Network (PEN) and the Site-based dataset for Assessment of Changing Land cover by JAXA project (SACLAJ) were established. In this chapter, we first introduce some of our findings from these two projects, and then we discuss the usability, other related issues, and the outlook of integrated ecosystem studies that use both in situ and satellite RS-observed data. © 2020 American Geophysical Union.

AB  - Networks of sensors could be used to evolve biomonitoring for environmental and biodiversity conservation subsidies in agriculture away from the ‘obligation of means’, where farmers receive financial support for those practices that have been put in place, to one of an ‘obligation of results’ where subsidies are paid when the wanted environmental benefits of a practice are observed. The sensor technologies that have been developed to date fall into a relatively narrow set of classes, based upon optical, sound and radio-magnetic waves, and these have predominantly used active technologies that emit and receive signals. We believe that passive sensors, which only receive signals for display and analysis, and that detect across a larger set of signal classes would have clear benefits of simplicity, robustness and cost for biomonitoring in agricultural landscapes. The use of passive sensors would allow non-scientist actors, such as farmers and citizens living in agricultural landscapes, to conduct monitoring of biodiversity and for pest and disease decision-making, promoting inclusion in the process. Feedback from citizens to farmers, where the monitoring shows a positive effect of the practices adopted, would also work positively, increasing farmer well-being and further improving uptake of biomonitoring. The downsides of passive sensors, which include poor signal quality and low taxonomic resolution, could in part be overcome by a combination of high uptake, by ensuring that the sensors are employed at high replication and have broad coverage of agricultural landscape habitat types, and by developing back-office computing systems that can appropriately process, analyse and curate the data collected. These systems would facilitate a joined-up approach to agricultural landscapes because they could both combine biomonitoring across different agricultural habitats and provide metrics that could be linked to the activities of individual farmers. Such metrics could include derived variables, formed from measurements from multiple sensor types and remote-sensing, such as Essential Biodiversity Variables that are being developed for global biomonitoring of the environment, biodiversity and ecosystem services. This would bring together the biomonitoring of agricultural landscapes and larger, global-scale biomonitoring initiatives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ecological Methods, by the late T. R. E. Southwood and revised over the years by P. A. Henderson, has developed into a classic reference work for the field biologist. It provides a handbook of ecological methods and analytical techniques pertinent to the study of animals, with an emphasis on non-microscopic animals in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. It remains unique in the breadth of the methods presented and in the depth of the literature cited, stretching right back to the earliest days of ecological research. The universal availability of R as an open-source package has radically changed the way ecologists analyze their data. In response, Southwood’s classic text has been thoroughly revised to be more relevant and useful to a new generation of ecologists, making the vast resource of R packages more readily available to the wider ecological community. By focusing on the use of R for data analysis, supported by worked examples, the book is now more accessible than previous editions to students requiring support and ideas for their projects. © Peter A.

AB  - Forest disturbances—driven by pests, pathogens, and discrete events—have led to billions of dollars in lost ecosystem services and management costs. To understand the patterns and severity of these stressors across complex landscapes, there must be an increase in reliable data at scales compatible with management actions. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS or UAV) offer a capable platform for collecting local scale (e.g., individual tree) forestry data. In this study, we evaluate the ca-pability of UAS multispectral imagery and freely available National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery for differentiating coniferous healthy, coniferous stressed, deciduous healthy, deciduous stressed, and degraded individual trees throughout a complex, mixed‐species forests. These methods are first compared to assessments of crown vigor in the field, to evaluate the potential in supplementing this resource intensive practice. This investigation uses the random forest and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to classify the imagery into the five forest health classes. Using the random forest classifier, the UAS imagery correctly classified five forest Health classes with an overall accuracy of 65.43%. Using similar methods, the high‐resolution airborne NAIP imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 50.50% for the five health classes, a reduction of 14.93%. When these classes were generalized to healthy, stressed, and degraded trees, the accuracy improved to 71.19%, using UAS imagery, and 70.62%, using airborne imagery. Further analysis into the precise calibration of UAS multispectral imagery, a refinement of image segmentation methods, and the fusion of these data with more widely distributed remotely sensed imagery would further enhance the potential of these methods to more effectively and efficiently collect forest health information from the UAS instead of using field methods. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The paper presents an underwater holographic sensor to study marine particles—a miniDHC digital holographic camera, which may be used as part of a hydrobiological probe for accompanying (background) measurements. The results of field measurements of plankton are given and interpreted, their verification is performed. Errors of measurements and classification of plankton particles are estimated. MiniDHC allows measurement of the following set of background data, which is confirmed by field tests: plankton concentration, average size and size dispersion of individuals, particle size distribution, including on major taxa, as well as water turbidity and suspension statistics. Version of constructing measuring systems based on modern carriers of operational oceanography for the purpose of ecological diagnostics of the world ocean using autochthonous plankton are discussed. The results of field measurements of plankton using miniDHC as part of a hydrobiological probe are presented and interpreted, and their verification is carried out. The results of comparing the data on the concentration of individual taxa obtained using miniDHC with the data obtained by the traditional method using plankton catching with a net showed a difference of no more than 23%. The article also contains recommendations for expanding the potential of miniDHC, its purpose indicators, and improving metrological characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 has found successful application in inland and coastal water remote sensing. Its radiometric specification and high spatial resolution allows quantification of water-leaving radiance while resolving small water bodies. However, its limited multispectral band set restricts the range of water quality parameters that can be retrieved. Identification of cyanobacteria biomass has been demonstrated for sensors with a band centered near 620 nm, the absorption peak of the diagnostic pigment phycocyanin. While OLI lacks such a band in the orange region, superposition of the available multispectral and panchromatic bands suggests that it can be calculated by a scaled difference. A set of 428 in situ spectra acquired in diverse lakes in Belgium and The Netherlands was used to develop and test an orange contra-band retrieval algorithm, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 5.39% and a bias of 0.88% in the presence of sensor noise. Atmospheric compensation error propagated to the orange contra-band was observed to maintain about the same magnitude (13% higher) observed for the red band and thus results in minimal additional effects for possible base line subtraction or band ratio algorithms for phycocyanin estimation. Generality of the algorithm for different reflectance shapes was tested against a set of published average coastal and inland Optical Water Types, showing robust retrieval for all but relatively clear water types (Secchi disk depth > 6 m and chlorophyll a < 1.6 mg m-3). The algorithm was further validated with 79 matchups against the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) orange band for 10 globally distributed lakes. The retrieved band is shown to convey information independent from the adjacent bands under variable phycocyanin concentrations. An example application using Landsat 8 imagery is provided for a known cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Erie, US. The method is distributed in the ACOLITE atmospheric correction code. The contra-band approach is generic and can be applied to other sensors with overlapping bands. Recommendations are also provided for development of future sensors with broad spectral bands with the objective to maximize the accuracy of possible spectral enhancements. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - Despite their ecological role and multiple contributions to human societies, the distribution of Indo-Pacific seagrasses remains poorly known in many places. Herein, we outline a hierarchical spatially-explicit assessment framework to derive nation-wide synoptic knowledge of the distribution of seagrass species and communities. We applied the framework to New Caledonia (southwest Pacific Ocean) and its 36,200 km2 of reefs and lagoons. The framework is primarily field-based but can leverage various habitat maps derived from remote sensing. Field data collection can be stratified by map products and retrospectively contribute to developing new seagrass distribution maps. Airborne and satellite remote sensing alone do not allow for the spatial generalisation of the finest attributes (species distribution and types of seagrass beds), but staged stratified field sampling provides synoptic views of these attributes. Using three examples, we discuss how the hierarchical and spatial information generated from this framework's application can inform conservation and management objectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ocean monitoring will improve outcomes if ways of knowing and priorities from a range of interest groups are successfully integrated. Coastal Indigenous communities hold unique knowledge of the ocean gathered through many generations of inter-dependent living with marine ecosystems. Experiences and observations from living within that system have generated ongoing local and traditional ecological knowledge (LEK and TEK) and Indigenous knowledge (IK) upon which localized sustainable management strategies have been based. Consequently, a comprehensive approach to ocean monitoring should connect academic practices ("science") and local community and Indigenous practices, encompassing "TEK, LEK, and IK." This paper recommends research approaches and methods for connecting scientists, local communities, and IK holders and their respective knowledge systems, and priorities, to help improve marine ecosystem management. Case studies from Canada and New Zealand (NZ) highlight the emerging recognition of IK systems in natural resource management, policy and economic development. The in-depth case studies from Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) and the new Moana Project, NZ highlight real-world experiences connecting IK with scientific monitoring programs. Trial-tested recommendations for successful collaboration include practices for two-way knowledge sharing between scientists and communities, co-development of funding proposals, project plans and educational resources, mutually agreed installation of monitoring equipment, and ongoing sharing of data and research results. We recommend that future ocean monitoring research be conducted using cross-cultural and/or transdisciplinary approaches. Vast oceans and relatively limited monitoring data coupled with the urgency of a changing climate emphasize the need for all eyes possible providing new data and insights. Community members and ocean monitoring scientists in joint research teams are essential for increasing ocean information using diverse methods compared with previous scientific research. Research partnerships can also ensure impactful outcomes through improved understanding of community needs and priorities. © 2019 Kaiser, Hoeberechts, Maxwell, Eerkes-Medrano, Hilmi, Safa, Horbel, Juniper, Roughan, Theux Lowen, Short and Paruru.

AB  - Lately, with deep learning outpacing the other machine learning techniques in classifying images, we have witnessed a growing interest of the remote sensing community in employing these techniques for the land use and land cover classification based on multispectral and hyperspectral images; the number of related publications almost doubling each year since 2015 is an attest to that. The advances in remote sensing technologies, hence the fast-growing volume of timely data available at the global scale, offer new opportunities for a variety of applications. Deep learning being significantly successful in dealing with Big Data, seems to be a great candidate for exploiting the potentials of such complex massive data. However, there are some challenges related to the ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that strongly impact the performance of classification. In this paper, we review the use of deep learning in land use and land cover classification based on multispectral and hyperspectral images and we introduce the available data sources and datasets used by literature studies; we provide the readers with a framework to interpret the-state-of-the-art of deep learning in this context and offer a platform to approach methodologies, data, and challenges of the field. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This book is an initial attempt to estimate the loads of heavy metal and nutrient loads into an industrial effluent receiving rivers of a typical industrializing catchment. It shows the effects and impacts of diffuse and point sources of these loads into the rivers, and illuminate management, capacity and policy gaps of riverine water and sediment monitoring in the sub-Saharan countries perspective from Ethiopia. The study was done in semi-arid catchments of Kombolcha city with industrialising urban and peri-urban areas in north-central Ethiopia. The Leyole and Worka rivers, which receives industrial effluent and wash-off from the catchments’ areas, were monitored for two years. This book contribute to our understanding on applicable methods to quantify loads of diffuse and point sources in data poor areas, and the most important contribution is to address the gaps in in controlling emission changes and. The results of this book contribute to the theory of river protection and understanding of water quality management of sub-Saharan African tropical rivers and sediments and provides policy options for improvement in rivers water quality of the sub-Saharan countries. In bridging this gap, this book proposed a model to estimate the total loads of nitrogen and phosphorus from a catchment. © 2019, Eskinder Zinabu Belachew.

AB  - We present ClassifyMe a software tool for the automated identification of animal species from camera trap images. ClassifyMe is intended to be used by ecologists both in the field and in the office. Users can download a pre-trained model specific to their location of interest and then upload the images from a camera trap to a laptop or workstation. ClassifyMe will identify animals and other objects (e.g., vehicles) in images, provide a report file with the most likely species detections, and automatically sort the images into sub-folders corresponding to these species categories. False Triggers (no visible object present) will also be filtered and sorted. Importantly, the ClassifyMe software operates on the user’s local machine (own laptop or workstation)—not via internet connection. This allows users access to state-of-the-art camera trap computer vision software in situ, rather than only in the office. The software also incurs minimal cost on the end-user as there is no need for expensive data uploads to cloud services. Furthermore, processing the images locally on the users’ end-device allows them data control and resolves privacy issues surrounding transfer and third-party access to users’ datasets. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Modern agriculture faces the dual challenges of feeding a growing human population, while preserving natural resources and slowing current trends in climate change and its impacts. A deep understanding of the functioning of agricultural landscapes appears crucial if we are to move towards sustainable, complex and resilient agroecosystems. Modelling is a powerful tool to address these issues since it can inform these transformations by simulating the multiscale ecological flows and myriad interactions agroecosystems host, and the multilevel stakeholder actions and their feedbacks in landscapes. This chapter shows that models can provide guidance on the transition towards future multifunctional agricultural landscapes. We have focused on process-based models, which allow for a more thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how these may be manipulated. We first examine how models can simulate the structure and the dynamics of agricultural landscapes, emphasizing the complex mosaic of urban, peri-urban, rural and seminatural habitats. Then, we consider the simulation of biotic and abiotic flows and their complex interactions in the mosaic habitats. Using formalisms from the social sciences, we integrate human decision-making and actions into the landscape models, thereby encompassing a major component in the landscape transformation process. Finally, we outline some avenues for future research. We have focused on improvements to landscape representation, and have suggested ways to bridge the gap between future landscape conception and manipulation, thus providing operational guidance for the transition towards future agricultural landscapes that achieve our objectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water quality measures for inland and coastal waters are available as discrete samples from professional and volunteer water quality monitoring programs and higher-frequency, near-continuous data from automated in situ sensors. Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biological data collection is entering a new era. Community science, satellite remote sensing (SRS), and local forms of remote sensing (e.g., camera traps and acoustic recordings) have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales and resolution. There is growing interest in developing observation networks to collect and synthesize data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but no examples of such networks have emerged to inform decision-making by agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin, which links synoptic environmental data derived from SRS to biodiversity observations collected continuously from a trail camera network to support management decision-making. We use several examples to illustrate that Snapshot Wisconsin improves the spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent of information available to support management, filling gaps associated with traditional monitoring and enabling consideration of new management strategies. JONs like Snapshot Wisconsin further strengthen monitoring inference by contributing novel lines of evidence useful for corroboration or integration. SRS provides environmental context that facilitates inference, prediction, and forecasting, and ultimately helps managers formulate, test, and refine conceptual models for the monitored systems. Although these approaches pose challenges, Snapshot Wisconsin demonstrates that expansive observation networks can be tractably managed by agencies to support decision making, providing a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Droughts will increase in frequency, intensity, duration, and spread under climate change. Drought affects numerous sectors in society and the natural environment, including short-term re-duced crop production, social conflict over water allocation, severe outmigration, and eventual fam-ine. Early action can prevent escalation of impacts, requiring drought early warning systems (DEWSs) that give current assessments and sufficient notice for active risk management. While most droughts are relatively slow in onset, often resulting in late responses, flash droughts are becoming more frequent, and their sudden onset poses challenging demands on DEWSs for timely communi-cation. We examine several DEWSs at global, regional, and national scales, with a special emphasis on agri-food systems. Many of these have been successful, such as some of the responses to 2015– 2017 droughts in Africa and Latin America. Successful examples show that early involvement of stakeholders, from DEWS development to implementation, is crucial. In addition, regional and global cooperation can cross-fertilize with new ideas, reduce reaction time, and raise efficiency. Broadening partnerships also includes recruiting citizen science and including seemingly subjective indigenous knowledge that can improve monitoring, data collection, and uptake of response measures. More precise and more useful DEWSs in agri-food systems will prove even more cost-effective in averting the need for emergency responses, improving global food security. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - An increasing variety of technologies are being developed to support conservation of endangered wildlife; however, comparatively little attention has been devoted to their design. We undertook three years of ethnographic fieldwork and design research with the recovery team of an endangered Australian bird (the Eastern bristlebird) to explore the team's culture and practices, as well as their perspectives on including collection and analysis of environmental acoustic recordings into their conservation praxis. Through thematic analysis, we identified the team's collective goals, culture, conservation activities, and technology use. We found that acoustic technologies have promise for supporting conservation of furtive and vocal Eastern bristlebirds. Trialing acoustic technologies also revealed that the team had strong interest in their use. We identified knowledge gaps, time constraints, and technology aversion as barriers to be overcome with future interaction design research. We offer an initial set of practical guidelines for designing technologies to support conservation. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Cities are recognised as key enablers for the world’s sustainable future. Urban sprawl and inefficient use of land are important issues significantly impacting the provision and use of open green spaces. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.7.1 aims at globally monitoring the amount of land that is dedicated by cities for public space. In Europe, the indicator “Share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood” is supposed to correspond to the SDG11.7.1 but is currently on-hold due to methodological issues and lack of data. Moreover, to efficiently assess public space conditions, timely and spatially disaggregated information is essential but not yet widely adopted by urban practitioners. Hereafter, we use a combination of satellite and crowdsourced Earth Observations (EO) to model physical accessibility to urban green spaces in four European cities. Findings suggest that it is technically feasible to derive information on the share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology represents a consistent, valid, reliable, low-cost, timely and continuous source of information for sustainable urban development. Open and free EO data can be a good complement to enhance official and traditional statistics on urban areas facilitating EU reporting against the SDG indicator for better comparison between EU countries. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Weeds can impact many ecosystems, including natural, urban and agricultural environments. This paper discusses core weed biosecurity program concepts and considerations for urban and peri-urban areas from a remote sensing perspective and reviews the contribution of remote sensing to weed detection and management in these environments. Urban and peri-urban landscapes are typically heterogenous ecosystems with a variety of vectors for invasive weed species introduction and dispersal. This diversity requires agile systems to support landscape-scale detection and monitoring, while accommodating more site-specific management and eradication goals. The integration of remote sensing technologies within biosecurity programs presents an opportunity to improve weed detection rates, the timeliness of surveillance, distribution and monitoring data availability, and the cost-effectiveness of surveillance and eradication efforts. A framework (the Weed Aerial Surveillance Program) is presented to support a structured approach to integrating multiple remote sensing technologies into urban and peri-urban weed biosecurity and invasive species management efforts. It is designed to support the translation of remote sensing science into operational management outcomes and promote more effective use of remote sensing technologies within biosecurity programs. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The accelerating rate of the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) and the magnitude of shipping traffic make the Mediterranean Sea a hotspot of biological invasions. For the effective management of NIS, early detection and intensive monitoring over time and space are essential. Here, we present an overview of possible applications of citizen science and remote sensing in monitoring alien seaweeds in the Mediterranean Sea. Citizen science activities, involving the public (e.g., tourists, fishermen, divers) in the collection of data, have great potential for monitoring NIS. The innovative methodologies, based on remote sensing techniques coupled with in situ/laboratory advanced sampling/analysis methods for tracking such species, may be useful and effective tools for easily assessing NIS distribution patterns and monitoring the space/time changes in habitats in order to support the sustainable management of the ecosystems. The reported case studies highlight how these cost-effective systems can be useful complementary tools for monitoring NIS, especially in marine protected areas, which, despite their fundamental role in the conservation of marine biodiversity, are not immune to the introduction of NIS. To ensure effective and long-lasting management strategies, collaborations between researchers, policy makers and citizens are essential. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Citizens are providing vast amounts of georeferenced data in the form of in situ data collections as well as interpretations and digitization of Earth-observation (EO) data sets. These new data streams have considerable potential for supporting the calibration and validation of current and future products derived from EO. We provide a general introduction to this growing area of interest and review existing crowdsourcing and citizen science (CS) initiatives of relevance to EO. We then draw upon our own experiences to provide case studies that highlight different types of data collection and citizen engagement and discuss the various barriers to adoption. Finally, we highlight opportunities for how citizens can become part of an integrated EO monitoring system in the framework of the European Union (EU) space program, including Copernicus and other monitoring initiatives. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In recent decades, phenology has become an important tool by which to measure both the impact of climate change on ecosystems and the feedback of ecosystems to the climate system. However, there has been little attempt to date to systematically quantify the increase in the number of scientific publications with a focus on phenology and climate change. In order to partially address this issue, we examined the number of articles (original papers, reviews and short communications) containing the terms ‘phenology’ and ‘climate change’ in the title, abstract or keywords, published in the International Journal of Biometeorology in the 60 years since its inception in 1957. We manually inspected all issues prior to 1987 for the search terms and subsequently used the search facility on the Web of Science online database. The overall number of articles published per decade remained relatively constant (255–378) but rose rapidly to 1053 in the most recent decade (2007–2016), accompanied by an increase (41–172) in the number of articles containing the search terms. A number of factors may have contributed to this rise, including the recognition of the value of phenology as an indicator of climate change and the initiation in 2010 of a series of conferences focusing on phenology which subsequently led to two special issues of the journal. The word ‘phenology’ was in use from the first issue, whereas ‘climate change’ only emerged in 1987 and peaked in 2014. New technologies such as satellite remote sensing and the internet led to an expansion of and greater access to a growing reservoir of phenological information. The application of phenological data included determining the impact of warming of phenophases, predicting wine quality and the pollen season, demonstrating the potential for mismatch to occur and both reconstructing and forecasting climate. Even though this analysis was limited to one journal, it is likely to be indicative of a similar trend across other scientific publications. © 2017, ISB.

AB  - This chapter shows how global environmental changes put society in front of new challenges, and how immediate and intense actions have to be undertaken in order to foster necessary progress in global sustainability research. The technological infrastructure has reached a status of ubiquitous computing and virtually unlimited data availability. Yet, the dynamic nature of the global environment makes continuous and in-situ monitoring challenging. Citizen-driven geographic information science can bridge this gap by building on inputs, observations, and the wisdom of the crowd, represented by the citizens themselves. This chapter argues for the important role of citizen science in geographic information science, presents its position in current research, and discusses future potential research streams, based on the participation by and collaboration with citizens. In particular, the chapter sheds light on three major pillars of the future of citizen-driven geographic information science, namely: big geo-data; education; and open science. © 2017, IGI Global.

AB  - The social and economic benefits of the coastal zone make it one of the most treasured environments on our planet. Yet it is vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Coastal management aims to mitigate these pressures while augmenting the socio-economic benefits the coastal region has to offer. However, coastal management is challenged by inadequate sampling of key environmental indicators, partly due to issues relating to cost of data collection. Here, we investigate the use of recreational surfers as platforms to improve sampling coverage of environmental indicators in the coastal zone. We equipped a recreational surfer, based in the south west United Kingdom (UK), with a temperature sensor and Global Positioning System (GPS) device that they used when surfing for a period of one year (85 surfing sessions). The temperature sensor was used to derive estimates of sea-surface temperature (SST), an important environmental indicator, and the GPS device used to provide sample location and to extract information on surfer performance. SST data acquired by the surfer were compared with data from an oceanographic station in the south west UK and with satellite observations. Our results demonstrate: (i) high-quality SST data can be acquired by surfers using low cost sensors; and (ii) GPS data can provide information on surfing performance that may help motivate data collection by surfers. Using recent estimates of the UK surfing population, and frequency of surfer participation, we speculate around 40 million measurements on environmental indicators per year could be acquired at the UK coastline by surfers. This quantity of data is likely to enhance coastal monitoring and aid UK coastal management. Considering surfing is a world-wide sport, our results have global implications and the approach could be expanded to other popular marine recreational activities for coastal monitoring of environmental indicators.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable that can be measured routinely from Earth Observation (EO) with high temporal and spatial coverage. To evaluate its suitability for an application, it is critical to know the accuracy and precision (performance) of the EO SST data. This requires comparisons with co-located and concomitant in situ data. Owing to a relatively large network of in situ platforms there is a good understanding of the performance of EO SST data in the open ocean. However, at the coastline this performance is not well known, impeded by a lack of in situ data. Here, we used in situ SST measurements collected by a group of surfers over a three year period in the coastal waters of the UK and Ireland, to improve our understanding of the performance of EO SST data at the coastline. At two beaches near the city of Plymouth, UK, the in situ SST measurements collected by the surfers were compared with in situ SST collected from two autonomous buoys located ∼7 km and ∼33 km from the coastline, and showed good agreement, with discrepancies consistent with the spatial separation of the sites. The in situ SST measurements collected by the surfers around the coastline, and those collected offshore by the two autonomous buoys, were used to evaluate the performance of operational Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) EO SST data. Results indicate: (i) a significant reduction in the performance of AVHRR at retrieving SST at the coastline, with root mean square errors in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 °C depending on the temporal difference between match-ups, significantly higher than those at the two offshore stations (0.4 to 0.6 °C); (ii) a systematic negative bias in the AVHRR retrievals of approximately 1 °C at the coastline, not observed at the two offshore stations; and (iii) an increase in the root mean square error at the coastline when the temporal difference between match-ups exceeded three hours. Harnessing new solutions to improve in situ sampling coverage at the coastline, such as tagging surfers with sensors, can improve our understanding of the performance of EO SST data in coastal regions, helping inform users interested in EO SST products for coastal applications. Yet, validating EO SST products using in situ SST data at the coastline is challenged by difficulties reconciling the two measurements, which are provided at different spatial scales in a dynamic and complex environment. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Monitoring the dynamics of the productivity of ocean water and how it affects fisheries is essential for management. It requires data on proper spatial and temporal scales, which can be provided by operational ocean colour satellites. However, accurate productivity data from ocean colour imagery is only possible with proper validation of, for instance, the atmospheric correction applied to the images. In situ water reflectance data are of great value due to the requirements for validation and reflectance is traditionally measured with the Surface Acquisition System (SAS) solar tracker system. Recently, an application for mobile devices, "HydroColor", was developed to acquire water reflectance data. We examined the accuracy of the water reflectance measures acquired by HydroColor with the help of both trained and untrained citizens, under different environmental conditions. We used water reflectance data acquired by SAS solar tracker and by HydroColor onboard the BC ferry Queen of Oak Bay from July to September 2016. Monte Carlo permutation F tests were used to assess whether the differences between measurements collected by SAS solar tracker and HydroColor with citizens were significant. Results showed that citizen HydroColor measurements were accurate in red, green, and blue bands, as well as red/green and red/blue ratios under different environmental conditions. In addition, we found that a trained citizen obtained higher quality HydroColor data especially under clear skies at noon. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) allow observation and reporting of global biodiversity change, but a detailed framework for the empirical derivation of specific EBVs has yet to be developed. Here, we re-examine and refine the previous candidate set of species traits EBVs and show how traits related to phenology, morphology, reproduction, physiology and movement can contribute to EBV operationalization. The selected EBVs express intra-specific trait variation and allow monitoring of how organisms respond to global change. We evaluate the societal relevance of species traits EBVs for policy targets and demonstrate how open, interoperable and machine-readable trait data enable the building of EBV data products. We outline collection methods, meta(data) standardization, reproducible workflows, semantic tools and licence requirements for producing species traits EBVs. An operationalization is critical for assessing progress towards biodiversity conservation and sustainable development goals and has wide implications for data-intensive science in ecology, biogeography, conservation and Earth observation. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Citizens are increasingly becoming involved in data collection, whether for scientific purposes, to carry out micro-tasks, or as part of a gamified, competitive application. In some cases, volunteered data collection overlaps with that of mapping agencies, e.g., the citizen-based mapping of features in OpenStreetMap. LUCAS (Land Use Cover Area frame Sample) is one source of authoritative in-situ data that are collected every three years across EU member countries by trained personnel at a considerable cost to taxpayers. This paper presents a mobile application called FotoQuest Austria, which involves citizens in the crowdsourcing of in-situ land cover and land use data, including at locations of LUCAS sample points in Austria. The results from a campaign run during the summer of 2015 suggest that land cover and land use can be crowdsourced using a simple protocol based on LUCAS. This has implications for remote sensing as this data stream represents a new source of potentially valuable information for the training and validation of land cover maps as well as for area estimation purposes. Although the most detailed and challenging classes were more difficult for untrained citizens to recognize, the agreement between the crowdsourced data and the LUCAS data for basic high level land cover and land use classes in homogeneous areas (ca. 80%) shows clear potential. Recommendations for how to further improve the quality of the crowdsourced data in the context of LUCAS are provided so that this source of data might one day be accurate enough for land cover mapping purposes. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - In response to increasing pressures on water resources, watershed services management programs are implemented throughout the tropics. These programs aim to promote land management activities that enhance the quantity and quality of water available to local communities. The success of these programs hinges on our ability to (a) understand the impacts of watershed interventions on ecohydrology; (b) model these impacts and design efficient management programs; and (c) develop strategies to overcome barriers to practical policy development, including resource limitations or the absence of baseline data. In this paper, we review opportunities in ecohydrological science that will help address these three challenges. The opportunities are grouped into measurement techniques, modelling approaches, and access to resources in our hyperconnected world. We then assess management implications of both the knowledge gaps and the new research developments related to the effect of land management. Overall, we stress the importance of policy-relevant knowledge for implementing efficient and equitable watershed services programs in the tropics. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Spatial analysis reaches across all the subdisciplines of anthropology. A cultural anthropologist, for example, can use such analysis to trace the extent of distinctive cultural practices; an archaeologist can use it to understand the organization of ancient irrigation systems; a primatologist to quantify the density of primate nesting sites; a paleoanthropologist to explore vast fossil-bearing landscapes. Arguing that geospatial analysis holds great promise for much anthropological inquiry, the contributors have designed this volume to show how the powerful tools of GIScience can be used to benefit a variety of research programs. This volume brings together scholars who are currently applying state-of-the-art tools, techniques, and methods of geographical information sciences (GIScience) to diverse data sets of anthropological interest. Their questions crosscut the typical "silos" that so often limit scholarly communication among anthropologists and instead recognize a deep structural similarity between the kinds of questions anthropologists ask, the data they collect, and the analytical models and paradigms they each use. © 2018 by the School for Advanced Research.

AB  - Two prominent limitations of species distribution models (SDMs) are spatial biases in existing occurrence data and a lack of spatially explicit predictor variables to fully capture habitat characteristics of species. Can existing and emerging remote sensing technologies meet these challenges and improve future SDMs? We believe so. Novel products derived from multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, as well as future Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and RADAR missions, may play a key role in improving model performance. In this perspective piece, we demonstrate how modern sensors onboard satellites, planes and unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionizing the way we can detect and monitor both plant and animal species in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as well as allowing the emergence of novel predictor variables appropriate for species distribution modeling. We hope this interdisciplinary perspective will motivate ecologists, remote sensing experts and modelers to work together for developing a more refined SDM framework in the near future. © 2015 The Authors Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Zoological Society of London.

AB  - Volunteered geographic data are being used increasingly to support land cover mapping and validation, yet the reliability of the volunteered data still requires further research. This study proposes data-based guidelines to help design the data collection by assessing the reliability of volunteered data collected using the Geo-Wiki tool. We summarized the interpretation difficulties of the volunteers at a global scale, including those areas and land cover types that generate the most confusion. We also examined the factors affecting the reliability of majority opinion and individual classification. The results showed that the highest interpretation inconsistency of the volunteers occurred in the ecoregions of tropical and boreal forests (areas with relatively poor coverage of very high resolution images), the tundra (a unique region that the volunteers are unacquainted with), and savannas (transitional zones). The volunteers are good at identifying forests, snow/ice and croplands, but not grasslands and wetlands. The most confusing pairs of land cover types are also captured in this study and they vary greatly with different biomes. The reliability can be improved by providing more high resolution ancillary data, more interpretation keys in tutorials, and tools that assist in coverage estimation for those areas and land cover types that are most prone to confusion. We found that the reliability of the majority opinion was positively correlated with the percentage of volunteers selecting this choice and negatively related to their self-evaluated uncertainty when very high resolution images were available. Factors influencing the reliability of individual classifications were also compared and the results indicated that the interpretation difficulty of the target sample played a more important role than the knowledge base of the volunteers. The professional background and local knowledge had an influence on the interpretation performance, especially in identifying vegetation land cover types other than croplands. These findings can help in building a better filtering system to improve the reliability of volunteered data used in land cover validation and other applications. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - To promote the advancement of novel observation techniques that may lead to new sources of information to help better understand the hydrological cycle, the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) established the Measurements and Observations in the XXI century (MOXXI) Working Group in July 2013. The group comprises a growing community of techenthusiastic hydrologists that design and develop their own sensing systems, adopt a multidisciplinary perspective in tackling complex observations, often use low-cost equipment intended for other applications to build innovative sensors, or perform opportunistic measurements. This paper states the objectives of the group and reviews major advances carried out by MOXXI members toward the advancement of hydrological sciences. Challenges and opportunities are outlined to provide strategic guidance for advancement of measurement, and thus discovery. © 2018 IAHS.

AB  - Climate change, air quality, and environmental degradation are important societal challenges for the Twenty-first Century. These challenges require an intelligent response from society, which in turn requires access to information about the Earth System. This information comes from observations and prior knowledge, the latter typically embodied in a model describing relationships between variables of the Earth System. Data assimilation provides an objective methodology to combine observational and model information to provide an estimate of themost likely state and its uncertainty for the whole Earth System. This approach adds value to the observations-by filling in the spatio-temporal gaps in observations; and to the model-by constraining it with the observations. In this review paper we motivate data assimilation as a methodology to fill in the gaps in observational information; illustrate the data assimilation approach with examples that span a broad range of features of the Earth System (atmosphere, including chemistry; ocean; land surface); and discuss the outlook for data assimilation, including the novel application of data assimilation ideas to observational information obtained using Citizen Science. Ultimately, a strong motivation of data assimilation is the many benefits it provides to users. These include: providing the initial state for weather and air quality forecasts; providing analyses and reanalyses for studying the Earth System; evaluating observations, instruments, andmodels; assessing the relative value of elements of the Global Observing System (GOS); and assessing the added value of future additions to the GOS. © 2014 Lahoz and Schneider.

AB  - Human activities have fundamentally altered the marine environment, creating a need for effective management in one of Earth's most challenging habitats. Remote camera imagery has emerged as an essential tool for monitoring at all scales, from individuals to populations and communities up to entire marine ecosystems. Here we review the use of remote cameras to monitor the marine environment in relation to human activity, and consider emerging and potential future applications. Rapid technological advances in equipment and analytical tools influence where, why, and how remote camera imagery can be applied. We encourage the inclusion of cameras within multi-method and multi-sensor approaches to improve our understanding of ecosystems and help manage human activities and minimize impacts. © The Ecological Society of America

AB  - Maintaining the health of aquatic systems is an essential component of sustainable catchment management, however, degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat continues to challenge scientists and policy-makers. To support management and restoration efforts aquatic system models are required that are able to capture the often complex trajectories that these systems display in response to multiple stressors. This paper explores the abilities and limitations of current model approaches in meeting this challenge, and outlines a strategy based on integration of flexible model libraries and data from observation networks, within a learning framework, as a means to improve the accuracy and scope of model predictions. The framework is comprised of a data assimilation component that utilizes diverse data streams from sensor networks, and a second component whereby model structural evolution can occur once the model is assessed against theoretically relevant metrics of system function. Given the scale and transdisciplinary nature of the prediction challenge, network science initiatives are identified as a means to develop and integrate diverse model libraries and workflows, and to obtain consensus on diagnostic approaches to model assessment that can guide model adaptation. We outline how such a framework can help us explore the theory of how aquatic systems respond to change by bridging bottom-up and top-down lines of enquiry, and, in doing so, also advance the role of prediction in aquatic ecosystem management. © 2015.

AB  - The World Ocean Assessment - or, to give its full title, The First Global Integrated Marine Assessment - is the outcome of the first cycle of the United Nations’ Regular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic Aspects. The Assessment provides vital, scientifically-grounded bases for the consideration of ocean issues, including climate change, by governments, intergovernmental agencies, non-governmental agencies and all other stakeholders and policymakers involved in ocean affairs. Together with future assessments and related initiatives, it will support the implementation of the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly its ocean-related goals. Moreover, it will also form an important reference text for marine science courses. © 2017 by the United Nations. All worldwide rights reserved.

AB  - Manta and devil rays are filter-feeding elasmobranchs that are found circumglobally in tropical and subtropical waters. Although relatively understudied for most of the Twentieth century, public awareness and scientific research on these species has increased dramatically in recent years. Much of this attention has been in response to targeted fisheries, international trade in mobulid products, and a growing concern over the fate of exploited populations. Despite progress in mobulid research, major knowledge gaps still exist, hindering the development of effective management and conservation strategies. We assembled 30 leaders and emerging experts in the fields of mobulid biology, ecology, and conservation to identify pressing knowledge gaps that must be filled to facilitate improved science-based management of these vulnerable species. We highlight focal research topics in the subject areas of taxonomy and diversity, life history, reproduction and nursery areas, population trends, bycatch and fisheries, spatial dynamics and movements, foraging and diving, pollution and contaminants, and sub-lethal impacts. Mobulid rays remain a poorly studied group, and therefore our list of important knowledge gaps is extensive. However, we hope that this identification of high priority knowledge gaps will stimulate and focus future mobulid research. © 2018 Stewart, Jaine, Armstrong, Armstrong, Bennett, Burgess, Couturier, Croll, Cronin, Deakos, Dudgeon, Fernando, Froman, Germanov, Hall, Hinojosa-Alvarez, Hosegood, Kashiwagi, Laglbauer, Lezama-Ochoa, Marshall, McGregor, Notarbartolo di Sciara, Palacios, Peel, Richardson, Rubin, Townsend, Venables and Stevens.

AB  - Proactive management of invasive species in urban areas is critical to restricting their overall distribution. The objective of this work is to determine whether advanced remote sensing technologies can help to detect invasions effectively and efficiently in complex urban ecosystems such as parks. In Surrey, BC, Canada, Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus) and English ivy (Hedera helix) are two invasive shrub species that can negatively affect native ecosystems in cities and managed urban parks. Random forest (RF) models were created to detect these two species using a combination of hyperspectral imagery, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. LiDAR-derived predictor variables included irradiance models, canopy structural characteristics, and orographic variables. RF detection accuracy ranged from 77.8 to 87.8% for Himalayan blackberry and 81.9 to 82.1% for English ivy, with open areas classified more accurately than areas under canopy cover. English ivy was predicted to occur across a greater area than Himalayan blackberry both within parks and across the entire city. Both Himalayan blackberry and English ivy were mostly located in clusters according to a Local Moran’s I analysis. The occurrence of both species decreased as the distance from roads increased. This study shows the feasibility of producing highly accurate detection maps of plant invasions in urban environments using a fusion of remotely sensed data, as well as the ability to use these products to guide management decisions. © 2016 Chance, Coops, Plowright, Tooke, Christen and Aven.

AB  - Citizen Science (CS) and crowdsourcing are two potentially valuable sources of data for Earth Observation (EO), which have yet to be fully exploited. Research in this area has increased rapidly during the last two decades, and there are now many examples of CS projects that could provide valuable calibration and validation data for EO, yet are not integrated into operational monitoring systems. A special issue on the role of CS in EO has revealed continued trends in applications, covering a diverse set of fields from disaster response to environmental monitoring (land cover, forests, biodiversity and phenology). These papers touch upon many key challenges of CS including data quality and citizen engagement as well as the added value of CS including lower costs, higher temporal frequency and use of the data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed imagery. Although still in the early stages of development, CS for EO clearly has a promising role to play in the future. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Marine environmental monitoring is undertaken to provide evidence that environmental management targets are being met. Moreover, monitoring also provides context to marine science and over the last century has allowed development of a critical scientific understanding of the marine environment and the impacts that humans are having on it. The seas around the UK are currently monitored by targeted, impact-driven, programmes (e.g., fishery or pollution based monitoring) often using traditional techniques, many of which have not changed significantly since the early 1900s. The advent of a new wave of automated technology, in combination with changing political and economic circumstances, means that there is currently a strong drive to move toward a more refined, efficient, and effective way of monitoring. We describe the policy and scientific rationale for monitoring our seas, alongside a comprehensive description of the types of equipment and methodology currently used and the technologies that are likely to be used in the future. We contextualize the way new technologies and methodologies may impact monitoring and discuss how whole ecosystems models can give an integrated, comprehensive approach to impact assessment. Furthermore, we discuss how an understanding of the value of each data point is crucial to assess the true costs and benefits to society of a marine monitoring programme. © 2017 Bean, Greenwood, Beckett, Biermann, Bignell, Brant, Copp, Devlin, Dye, Feist, Fernand, Foden, Hyder, Jenkins, van der Kooij, Kröger, Kupschus, Leech, Leonard, Lynam, Lyons, Maes, Nicolaus, Malcolm, McIlwaine, Merchant, Paltriguera, Pearce, Pitois, Stebbing, Townhill, Ware, Williams and Righton

AB  - The application of digital cameras to monitor the environment is becoming global and changing the way of phenological data collection. The technique of repeated digital photographs to monitor plant phenology (phenocams) has increased due to its low-cost investment, reduced size, easy set up installation, and the possibility of handling high-resolution near-remote data. Considering the widespread use of phenocams worldwide, our main goals here are: (i) to provide a step-by-step guide for phenocam set up in the tropics, reinforce its appliance as an efficient tool for monitoring tropical phenology and foster networking, (ii) to discuss phenocam applications for biological conservation, management, and ecological restoration. We provide the concepts and properties for image analysis which allow representing the phenological status of the vegetation. The association of a long-term imagery data with local sensors (e.g., meteorological stations and surface-atmosphere flux towers) allows a wide range of studies, especially linking phenological patterns to climatic drivers; and the impact of climate changes on plant responses. We show phenocams applications for conservation as to document disturbances and changes on vegetation structure, such as deforestation, fire events, and flooding and the vegetation recovery. Networks of phenocams are growing globally and represent an important tool for conservation and restoration, as it provides hourly to daily information of monitored systems spread over several sites, ecosystems, and climatic zones. Moreover, websites enriched by vegetation dynamic imagery data can promote science knowledge by engaging citizen science participation. © 2017 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly benefit from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at fine spatial resolution. Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of non-photosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The cooperative marine autonomous system (MAS), a combination of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), would provide researchers, governments, and conservationists unprecedented reach to study the marine environment and prepare for the effects of climate change. Ideally, these systems would be inexpensive and highly adaptable to build a network similar to that of the National Data Buoy Center, providing a complementary view of the world's oceans. To achieve this degree of proliferation, this paper discusses the fusion of a commercially available ASV, the C-Worker 6 (ASV Global, LLC, Portland, OR, USA) with the bio-inspired vehicle (BIV) (Aquaai Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA). The first, intended application for this system is performing coral reef photogrammetric studies. In this role, the ASV acts as a mobile base station for one to four individual BIVs; providing long-range transport between survey locations, battery recharging, data relay, and improved underwater navigational accuracy to the BIV via GPS-to-USBL communications. The BIV(s) then act(s) as extensions to the ASV's sensor network, providing imaging as well as in situ temperature, conductivity, and pressure data. This article examines the design challenges (and proposes solutions) associated with docking the BIV with the ASV as well as a reliable, safe power transfer mechanism for recharging the BIV. At the time of writing, the BIV and docking bay are under development, while the principle of improving underwater navigational accuracy using a MAS has been tested through a collaboration between ASV Global and the National Oceanographic Centre (Southampton, UK) (see Oceans 2017 Proceedings, Autonomous Surface/Sub-surface Survey System for further information). © 2017 Marine Technology Society.

AB  - The last few decades have seen dramatic increases in the abundance and variety of data that can be collected within benthic marine environments to monitor species and ecosystems. These developments are now allowing ecologists to view their study systems in ever greater detail and over scales ranging from microscopic to global. Here we give an overview of current widely used techniques, touch on a number of recent advances in both technologies and methodologies, and focus on photogrammetry. We recommend that greater synergies, standardization, and automation of a range of these methods could further improve many monitoring programs’ effectiveness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the high cost of traditional forest plot measurements, the availability of up-to-date in situ forest inventory data has been a bottleneck for remote sensing image analysis in support of the important global forest biomass mapping. Capitalizing on the proliferation of smartphones, citizen science is a promising approach to increase spatial and temporal coverages of in situ forest observations in a cost-effective way. Digital cameras can be used as a relascope device to measure basal area, a forest density variable that is closely related to biomass. In this paper, we present the Relasphone mobile application with extensive accuracy assessment in two mixed forest sites from different biomes. Basal area measurements in Finland (boreal zone) were in good agreement with reference forest inventory plot data on pine (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 5.33 m2/ha), spruce (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 6.73 m2/ha) and birch (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 4.98 m2/ha), with total relative RMSE(%) = 29.66%. In Durango, Mexico (temperate zone), Relasphone stem volume measurements were best for pine (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 32.46 m3/ha) and total stem volume (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 35.21 m3/ha). Relasphone data were then successfully utilized as the only reference data in combination with optical satellite images to produce biomass maps. The Relasphone concept has been validated for future use by citizens in other locations. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely retrieved from time series of various satellite instruments in order to monitor climate change and ecosystem dynamics. However, any evaluation of the quality of LSP data sets is quite challenging because the in situ observations on a limited number of individual trees, shrubs, or other plants are rarely representative of the landscape sampled in a single satellite pixel. Moreover, vegetation indices detecting biophysical features of vegetation seasonality are different from (but related to) the specific plant life history stages observed by humans at ground level. This study is the first comprehensive evaluation of the LSP product derived from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data using both MODIS LSP products and observations from the PhenoCam network across the Contiguous United States during 2013 and 2014. PhenoCam observes vegetation canopy over a landscape at very high frequency, providing nearly continuous canopy status and enabling the estimate of discrete phenophase using vegetation indices that are conceptually similar to satellite data. Six phenological dates (greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset) were retrieved separately from daily VIIRS NDVI (normalized difference vegetative index) and EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index) time series. Similarly, the six phenological dates were also extracted from the 30-min time series of PhenoCam data using GCC (green chromatic coordinate) and VCI (vegetation contrast index) separately. Phenological dates derived from VIIRS NDVI and EVI2 and PhenoCam GCC and VCI were generally comparable for the vegetation greenup phase, but differed considerably for the senescence phase. Although all indices captured green leaf development effectively, performance discrepancies arose due to their ability to track the mixture of senescing leaf colors. PhenoCam GCC and VCI phenological observations were in better agreement with the phenological dates from VIIRS EVI2 than from VIIRS NDVI. Further, the VIIRS EVI2 phenological metrics were more similar to those from PhenoCam VCI than from PhenoCam GCC time series. Overall, the average absolute difference between the VIIRS EVI2 and PhenoCam VCI phenological dates was 7–11 days in the greenup phase and 10–13 days in the senescence phase. The difference was smaller in forests, followed by grasslands and croplands, and then savannas. Finally, the phenological dates derived from VIIRS EVI2 were compared with MODIS detections, which showed a good agreement with an average absolute difference less than a week except for the senescence onset. These results for the first time demonstrate the upper boundary of uncertainty in VIIRS LSP detections and the continuity to MODIS LSP product. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An understanding of animal behaviour is important if conservation initiatives are to be effective. However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Taking the perspective that it is the human activities that require management rather than the biological systems that we disturb, this chapter will describe an adaptive management approach to environmental management. Using technological advancements such as remote sensing and geographic information systems, ecologists can determine the most successful ways to harmonize human disturbances with natural ones and identify feasible biological targets for the system of interest. Understanding the scale of the system and its processes is critical, and using large-scale data sets along with remote sensing can help ecologists determine where the system is, where it needs to be, and whether preservation is the right management decision or if more active restoration or rehabilitation is necessary. Indicators (measurable variables) are used to monitor system movement toward targets and responses to management actions. The adaptive management process is iterative, so that new information on the response of the ecosystem to our management activities is used to improve the next round of decisions. The environmental management of the Florida Everglades is used throughout as an illustrative case study of how ecologists have used an adaptive management approach to restore and preserve an internationally famous ecosystem. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - With more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, it is vitally important that towns and cities are healthy places to live. The principal aim of this book is to synthesize the disparate literature on the use of vegetation in the built environment and its multifunctional benefits to humans. The author reviews issues such as: contact with wildlife and its immediate and long-term effects on psychological and physical wellbeing; the role of vegetation in removing health-damaging pollutants from the air; green roofs and green walls, which provide insulation, reduce energy use and decrease the carbon footprint of buildings; and structural vegetation such as street trees, providing shading and air circulation whilst also helping to stop flash-floods through surface drainage. Examples are used throughout to illustrate the practical use of vegetation to improve the urban environment and deliver ecosystem services. Whilst the underlying theme is the value of biodiversity, the emphasis is less on existing high-value green spaces (such as nature reserves, parks and gardens), than on the sealed surfaces of urban areas (building surfaces, roads, car parks, plazas, etc.). The book shows how these, and the spaces they encapsulate, can be modified to meet current and future environmental challenges including climate change. The value of existing green space is also covered to provide a comprehensive textbook of international relevance. © 2015 John W. Dover.

AB  - This paper presents a collective sensing approach that integrates imperfect Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) obtained through Citizen Science (CS) tree mapping projects with very high resolution (VHR) optical remotely sensed data for low-cost, fine-scale, and accurate mapping of trees in urban orchards. To this end, an individual tree crown (ITC) detection technique utilizing template matching (TM) was developed for extracting urban orchard trees from VHR optical imagery. To provide the training samples for the TM algorithm, remotely sensed VGI about trees including the crowdsourced data about ITC locations and their crown diameters was adopted in this study. A data quality assessment of the proposed approach in the study area demonstrated that the detected trees had a very high degree of completeness (92.7%), a high thematic accuracy (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.090, false negative rate (FNR) = 0.073, and F1 score (F1) = 0.918), and a fair positional accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.02 m). Overall, the proposed approach based on the crowdsourced training samples generally demonstrated a promising ITC detection performance in our pilot project. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Human-driven global change is causing ongoing declines in biodiversity worldwide. In order to address these declines, decision-makers need accurate assessments of the status of and pressures on biodiversity. However, these are heavily constrained by incomplete and uneven spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. For instance, data from regions such as Europe and North America are currently used overwhelmingly for large-scale biodiversity assessments due to lesser availability of suitable data from other, more biodiversity-rich, regions. These data-poor regions are often those experiencing the strongest threats to biodiversity, however. There is therefore an urgent need to fill the existing gaps in global biodiversity monitoring. Here, we review current knowledge on best practice in capacity building for biodiversity monitoring and provide an overview of existing means to improve biodiversity data collection considering the different types of biodiversity monitoring data. Our review comprises insights from work in Africa, South America, Polar Regions and Europe; in government-funded, volunteer and citizen-based monitoring in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The key steps to effectively building capacity in biodiversity monitoring are: identifying monitoring questions and aims; identifying the key components, functions, and processes to monitor; identifying the most suitable monitoring methods for these elements, carrying out monitoring activities; managing the resultant data; and interpreting monitoring data. Additionally, biodiversity monitoring should use multiple approaches including extensive and intensive monitoring through volunteers and professional scientists but also harnessing new technologies. Finally, we call on the scientific community to share biodiversity monitoring data, knowledge and tools to ensure the accessibility, interoperability, and reporting of biodiversity data at a global scale. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Artificial light at night is profoundly altering natural light cycles, particularly as perceived by many organisms, over extensive areas of the globe. This alteration comprises the introduction of light at night at places and times at which it has not previously occurred, and with different spectral signatures. Given the long geological periods for which light cycles have previously been consistent, this constitutes a novel environmental pressure, and one for which there is evidence for biological effects that span from molecular to community level. Here we provide a synthesis of understanding of the form and extent of this alteration, some of the key consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, interactions and synergies with other anthropogenic pressures on the environment, major uncertainties, and future prospects and management options. This constitutes a compelling example of the need for a thoroughly interdisciplinary approach to understanding and managing the impact of one particular anthropogenic pressure. The former requires insights that span molecular biology to ecosystem ecology, and the latter contributions of biologists, policy makers and engineers. © 2014, The Author(s).

AB  - Visual animal biometrics is an emerging research discipline in computer vision, pattern recognition and cognitive science. It is a promising research field that encourages new development of quantified algorithms and methodologies for representing, detection of visible features, phenotypic appearances of species, individuals and recognition of morphological and animal biometric characteristics. Furthermore, it also assists the study of animal trajectory and behaviours analysis of species. Currently, real-world applications of visual animal biometric systems are gaining more proliferation due to a variety of applications and use, enhancement of quantity and quality of the collection of extensive ecological data and processing. However, to advance visual animal biometrics will require integration of methodologies among the scientific disciplines involved. Such valuable efforts will be worthwhile due to the enormous perspective of this approach rests with the formal abstraction of phenomics, to build well-developed interfaces between different organisational levels of life. This study provides a comprehensive survey of visual animal biometric systems and recognition approaches for various species and individual animal based on their morphological image pattern and biometric characteristics. This comprehensive review paper encourages the multidisciplinary researchers, scientists, biologists and different research communities to design the better platforms for the development of efficient algorithms and learning models to solve the massive data processing, classification and identification of different species related problems. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.

AB  - Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) consolidate information from varied biodiversity observation sources. Here we demonstrate the links between data sources, EBVs and indicators and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing. We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps. We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and North America and that ecological field studies play a key role in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical data gaps. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - The editors of this book have used their combined 90 years of experience working on the behaviour and ecology of wild carnivores to draw together a unique network of the world’s experts on musteloid biology and conservation. The musteloids are the most speciose and diverse super-family among carnivores, ranging from little known, exotic, and highly-endangered species to the popular and familiar, and include a large number of introduced invasives. They feature terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal, and aquatic members, ranging from tenacious predators to frugivorous omnivores, span weights from a 100g weasel to 30kg giant otters, and express a range of social behaviours from the highly gregarious to the fiercely solitary. Their diversity and extensive biogeography inform a wide spectrum of ecological theory and conservation practice. Beginning with a brief account of 93 musteloid species, there follow eight comprehensive review chapters covering topics most relevant to musteloid biology and conservation: evolution, form and function, population dynamics, communication, social organisation, exploitation and conflict with people, study tools and techniques, and disease. Twenty detailed case studies then delve into the very best species investigations worldwide, written by leading figures in the field, and providing a range of geographic and taxonomic coverage. The final chapter synthesises what has been discussed in the book, and reflects on the different and diverse conservation needs of musteloids and the wealth of conservation lessons they offer. © Oxford University Press 2017.

AB  - Ecology has joined a world of big data. Two complementary frameworks define big data: data that exceed the analytical capacities of individuals or disciplines or the “Four Vs” axes of volume, variety, veracity, and velocity. Variety predominates in ecoinformatics and limits the scalability of ecological science. Volume varies widely. Ecological velocity is low but growing as data throughput and societal needs increase. Ecological big-data systems include in situ and remote sensors, community data resources, biodiversity databases, citizen science, and permanent stations. Technological solutions include the development of open code- and data-sharing platforms, flexible statistical models that can handle heterogeneous data and sources of uncertainty, and cloud-computing delivery of high-velocity computing to large-volume analytics. Cultural solutions include training targeted to early and current scientific workforce and strengthening collaborations among ecologists and data scientists. The broader goal is to maximize the power, scalability, and timeliness of ecological insights and forecasting. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The open access availability of satellite images from new sensors characterized by various spatial and temporal resolutions provides new challenges and possibilities for biodiversity conservation. Methodologies aiming at characterizing vegetation type, phenology, and function can now benefit from metric spatial resolution imagery combined with an improved revisit capability. Here, we test hybrid methods and data fusion, using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) sensors in different complex landscapes encompassing three French biogeographical regions. The methodological approach presented herein has a generic value in response to national conservation targets based on the concept of essential biodiversity variables accessed by remote sensing (RS-enabled EBVs). We focused on deriving five RS-enabled EBVs from natural and seminatural open ecosystems: (1) ecosystem distribution, (2) land cover, (3) heterogeneity, (4) primary productivity and (5) vegetation phenology. The challenge was to develop a method that would be technically feasible, economically viable, and sustainable in time. We demonstrated that it is possible to derive key parameters required to develop a set of EBVs from remote sensing (RS) data. The combined use of remote sensing data sources with various spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions is essential to obtain different indicators of natural habitats. One major current challenge for an improved contribution of RS to conservation is to strengthen multiple collaborative frameworks among remote sensing scientists, conservation biologists, and ecologists in order to increase the efficiency of methodological exchange and draw benefits for successful conservation planning strategies. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Spectroscopy is the science concerned with the investigation and measurement of spectra produced when materials interacts with or emits electromagnetic radiation. Commercial infrared spectrometer were designed from the 1950’s onward and found their way into the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In the 1970’s and 1980’s also natural sciences notably mineralogy and vegetation science started systematically to measure optical properties of leaves and minerals/rocks with spectrometers. In the last decade spectroscopy has made the step from qualitative observations of mineral classes, soil type and vegetation biomass to quantitative estimates of mineral, soil and vegetation chemistry. This resulted in geothermometers used to characterize metamorphic and hydrothermal systems and to the advent of foliar biochemistry. More research is still needed to bridge the gap between laboratory spectroscopy and field spectroscopy. Empirical studies of minerals either as soil or rock constituents (and vegetation parameters) derived from regression analysis of spectra against chemistry is important in understanding the physics of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation and matter which in turn is important in the design of future satellite missions. Physics based models and retrievals are needed to operationalize these relationships and implement them in future earth observation missions as these are more robust and easy to transfer to other areas and data sets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid changes to the biosphere are altering ecological processes worldwide. Developing informed policies for mitigating the impacts of environmental change requires an exponential increase in the quantity, diversity, and resolution of field-collected data, which, in turn, necessitates greater reliance on innovative technologies to monitor ecological processes across local to global scales. Automated digital time-lapse cameras - "phenocams" - can monitor vegetation status and environmental changes over long periods of time. Phenocams are ideal for documenting changes in phenology, snow cover, fire frequency, and other disturbance events. However, effective monitoring of global environmental change with phenocams requires adoption of data standards. New continental-scale ecological research networks, such as the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the European Union's Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS), can serve as templates for developing rigorous data standards and extending the utility of phenocam data through standardized ground-truthing. Open-source tools for analysis, visualization, and collaboration will make phenocam data more widely usable. © The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - This paper explores technologies currently expanding the physical scope of air pollution monitoring and their potential contributions to the assessment of sustainable development. This potential lies largely in the ability of these technologies to address issues typically on the fringe of the air pollution agenda. Air pollution monitoring tends to be primarily focused on human health, and largely neglects other aspects of sustainable development. Sensor networks, with their relatively inexpensive monitoring nodes, allow for monitoring with finer spatiotemporal resolution. This resolution can support more conclusive studies of air pollution's effect on socio-ecological justice and human quality of life. Satellite observation of air pollution allows for wider geographical scope, and in doing so can facilitate studies of air pollution's effects on natural capital and ecosystem resilience. Many air pollution-related aspects of the sustainability of development in human systems are not being given their due attention. Opportunities exist for air pollution monitoring to attend more to these issues. Improvements to the resolution and scale of monitoring make these opportunities realizable. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A central goal of animal ecology is to observe species in the natural world. The cost and challenge of data collection often limit the breadth and scope of ecological study. Ecologists often use image capture to bolster data collection in time and space. However, the ability to process these images remains a bottleneck. Computer vision can greatly increase the efficiency, repeatability and accuracy of image review. Computer vision uses image features, such as colour, shape and texture to infer image content. I provide a brief primer on ecological computer vision to outline its goals, tools and applications to animal ecology. I reviewed 187 existing applications of computer vision and divided articles into ecological description, counting and identity tasks. I discuss recommendations for enhancing the collaboration between ecologists and computer scientists and highlight areas for future growth of automated image analysis. © 2017 The Author.

AB  - Accurate observations of the Earth system are required to understand how our planet is changing and to help manage its resources. The aquatic environment-including lakes, rivers, wetlands, estuaries, coastal and open oceans-is a fundamental component of the Earth system controlling key physical, biological, and chemical processes that allow life to flourish. Yet, this environment is critically undersampled in both time and space. New and cost-effective sampling solutions are urgently needed. Here, we highlight the potential to improve aquatic sampling by tapping into recreation. We draw attention to the vast number of participants that engage in aquatic recreational activities and argue, based on current technological developments and recent research, that the time is right to employ recreational citizens to improve large-scale aquatic sampling efforts. We discuss the challenges that need to be addressed for this strategy to be successful (e.g., sensor integration, data quality, and citizen motivation), the steps needed to realize its potential, and additional societal benefits that arise when engaging citizens in scientific sampling. © 2017 Brewin, Hyder, Andersson, Billson, Bresnahan, Brewin, Cyronak, Dall'Olmo, de Mora, Graham, Jackson and Raitsos.

AB  - Access to Space-enabled observation systems is getting increasingly faster, intuitive, and automated. Several players are offering 24/7 imagery from first class satellites and their high resolution optical and radar sensors. Others are vying for large constellations to provide full Earth coverage based on optical sensor suites. However, current near real-time commercial services usually have latencies of about 7 hours between the captured event and the moment a user can access the data; and insufficient revisit frequencies of all-weather (SAR) enabled satellites do not allow for setting up early warning systems for fast developing events related with security, extreme weather, sudden harmful blooms (such as HABs) posing risks to human health and economic activities. This shortcoming is particularly relevant in maritime areas, where there are few or none in situ sensors. Together with IPMA, the Portuguese institution tasked with coordinating research on the sea and atmosphere, TEKEVER is assessing a new microsatellite constellation equipped with distributed optical and radar sensors to allow hourly revisits, integrated with in situ and airborne sensors, and ecosystem and environmental models to provide cost-effective early warning systems targeting extreme events. This service would be focused on reducing the gap between satellite data collection and processing, and its availability to end users, making it suitable for fast developing events. The assessment will focus on real-time monitoring of Portuguese waters based on satellite and model data, representing a supplemental cost-effective solution that will increase the chances of predicting exceptional events before they reach the coast, reducing risks and economic losses, revealing intra- and inter-annual variations, as well as expressing trends that might reflect changes in the climate system. It will impact regulators, monitoring bodies, industry and coastal zone managers.
